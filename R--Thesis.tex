IMPLICIT MEMORY: PSE results from conceptual processing of a picture's
distinctive features (rather than semantic information). General
semantic task: ``What is a used car sometimes called?'' No PSE.
Distinctive conceptual information task: ``What fruit is egg shaped?''
PSE.

EXPLICIT RECOGNITION: PSE always evident?

aMCI Show larger PSE effects than controls.

Impaired REC, so this PSE must rely on FAM?

Mixed findings whether fam is intact in aMCI. Intact - generally use
picture stim. Impaired - generally use verbal stim.

Is PSE in aMCI driven by intact FAM for pictures, but impaired FAM for
words? Yes (Embree, Budson, \& Ally, 2012): aMCI - Picture FAM - same as
healthy OAs aMCI - Word FAM - impaired compared to healthy OAs

Ally, McKeever, 2009: Examined early frontal old/new effect (FAM) in
aMCI: Intact for pictures. Impaired for words. BUT, P did not provide
subjective Rec/Fam reports.

Embree, Budson, \& Ally, 2012: Deep encoding (verbal like/dislike
response). Modified Old/New (6-point rating scale): 6. Certain the item
is old - to - 1. Certain the item is new.

Both used the same picture stim - colour photos.

Dual-process theories of recognition memory suggest that two independent
processes - recollection and familiarity - are implicated in the
successful recognition of previously encountered material (Paivio, 1971,
1972). Recollection typically refers to the conscious recall of encoded
information, whereby contextual details (usually obtained by mentally
re-experiencing a previous encounter with the stimulus) facilitate
successful recognition. Familiarity, on the other hand, describes the
unsubstantiated \emph{feeling} of having encountered the stimulus
before, and despite the inability to retrieve any associated diagnostic
information, is still able to produce accurate recognition (Schoemaker,
Gauthier, \& Pruessner, 2014). While single-process accounts of
recognition memory have been proposed, with the view that such
experiences can be understood simply as varying levels of memory
strength (Dunn, 2008; Squire, Wixted, \& Clark, 2007), the majority of
memory researchers agree that multiple processes are necessary to
account for a range of dissociable experimental findings (Yonelinas,
2002). Evidence from studies utilising event related potentials (ERPs;
Curran \& Doyle, 2011), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI;
Scalici, Caltagirone, \& Carlesimo, 2017) and comparisons between
healthy and clinical subject groups (e.g.~Mild Cognitive Impairment;
Belleville, MÃ©nard, \& Lepage, 2011) all implicate the existence of two
functionally distinct processes. Despite this consensus, disagreement
persists in the literature regarding the extent to which recollection
and familiarity are independent, and the methods that should be used to
measure them most effectively (Schoemaker et al., 2014; Yonelinas,
2002).

~

Experiments into recognition memory often focus on obtaining separate
estimates of recollection and familiarity using process-estimation
methods (Yonelinas, 2002). The most commonly used process-estimation
method is the Remember/Know (RK) paradigm (Tulving, 1985) - a task
endorsed by a wide body of literature (Gardiner, 2000; Jacoby, 1991;
Jacoby, Yonelinas, \& Jennings, 1997; Yonelinas \& Jacoby, 1995). In a
typical RK procedure, participants are generally tasked with making
`old' vs.~`new' recognition decisions toward a randomised list of items,
many of which were presented during an earlier encoding phase (targets)
amongst novel items with highly similar characteristics (lures). When a
subject recognises an item, and thus selects \emph{Old}, a follow-up
judgement probes how they arrived at this decision (\emph{Remember} or
\emph{Know}). If the subject was able to recognise the item based on
recollection (i.e.~conscious recall of some diagnostic information: ``I
remember seeing this item earlier''), they should classify their
recognition as \emph{Remember}. If the subject arrived at their
recognition decision due to familiarity (i.e.~a feeling of certainty
that the item was studied in the encoding phase, but unable to recall
and details: ``I know I saw this item earlier, but cannot determine
why''), they should classify their recognition as \emph{Know}. In
addition to the literature endorsing the task in healthy samples, a
large body of research also reports that the RK procedure produces
reliable estimations of recollection and familiarity in clinical
populations (Lombardi, Perri, Fadda, Caltagirone, \& Carlesimo, 2016);
for example, those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) typically
produce results to suggest recollection impairments but intact
familiarity compared to healthy older adults (Belleville et al., 2011;
Hudon, Belleville, \& Gauthier, 2009; Lombardi et al., 2016; Serra et
al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013).

~

The RK procedure has been modified in a number of ways since its
conception, and continues to adapt as understandings of recollection and
familiarity processes evolve. An early development was the
``independence correction'' - a formula devised to `correct' the
inherent underestimation of familiarity processes within the mutually
exclusive paradigm (Yonelinas \& Jacoby, 1995). Participants are
generally only instructed to select \emph{Know} (a reflection of
familiarity) when there is an absence of recollection, however, this
approach does not allow for the possibility of recollection and
familiarity co-occurring. Proportions of \emph{Know} responses will
likely always be lower than \emph{Remember} if subjects do indeed
perceive to experience both processes simultaneously, since the presence
of recollection necessitates that they select the \emph{Remember} option
among the two choices. When the Yonelinas \& Jacoby (1995) independence
correction is applied, estimates of familiarity are determined by also
taking into account the number of times \emph{Remember} was selected
when calculating the proportion of \emph{Know} responses (Schoemaker et
al., 2014). An alternative to this correction is to modify the response
options available to subjects, so they are able to individually
determine the relative contributions of each process. Higham \& Vokey
(2004) proposed an independent ratings methodology whereby, instead of
the binary \emph{Remember}/\emph{Know} options, subjects are provided
with one rating scale to report the contribution of recollection and
another to report the contribution of familiarity (RF-Ratings).
Participants rate their recognition experience for each process
accordingly: 1 = \emph{definitely no}, 2 = \emph{probably no}, 3 =
\emph{probably yes}, 4 = \emph{definitely yes}. Such options allow for
great variability in the way participants are able to respond, and for
the possibility of both processes occurring conjointly: i) Recollection
without Familiarity (high rating on R, low rating on F); ii) Familiarity
without Recollection (high rating on F, low rating on R); iii) both
Recollection \emph{and} Familiarity (high rating on R and F); iv)
neither R or F, i.e.~a guess (\emph{1} rating on R and F). The
methodology of Higham \& Vokey (2004) has been used in numerous studies
(Brown \& Bodner, 2011; Kurilla \& Westerman, 2008; Tousignant \&
Bodner, 2012), however, it could be argued that this rating task is
somewhat removed from the original \emph{judgement} task, and the extent
to which the increased task complexity affects reports of recognition is
unknown (Tousignant, Bodner, \& Arnold, 2015).

~

Further modifications retain the original two binary response options,
but avoid the mutual exclusivity issue by simply including a \emph{Both}
option (Tousignant et al., 2015). When calculating proportions of
recollection and familiarity, the total proportion of \emph{Both}
responses can then be separately added to the totals for each process.
Recent adaptations of the RK paradigm have also begun to include a
\emph{Guess} response option, allowing participants to report
uncertainty in their recognition decision (Belleville et al., 2011;
Eldridge, Sarfatti, \& Knowlton, 2002; Larsson, Ãberg, \& BÃ¤ckman, 2006;
Tunney \& Fernie, 2007; Williams, 2019). Previous studies have found
that subjects may falsely assign guesses to the \emph{Know} option when
there is no explicit \emph{Guess} option available (Gardiner, Java, \&
Richardson-Klavehn, 1996; Gardiner \& Ramponi, 1998; Gardiner, Ramponi,
\& Richardson-Klavehn, 2002), on the assumption that this option more
closely resembles their state of low confidence (Tunney \& Fernie,
2007). Responding in this manner may artificially inflate obtained
estimates of familiarity (Tunney \& Fernie, 2007). By including
\emph{Guess}, the likelihood of obtaining false \emph{Know} responses
(i.e.~those that do not reflect underlying familiarity processes) is
reduced (Migo, Mayes, \& Montaldi, 2012).

~

Despite its widespread use, the RK procedure has been criticized for its
reliance on participants' subjective understanding of the provided
instructions (Schoemaker et al., 2014), and the introspective nature of
recognition judgements make it difficult to confirm whether all
participants have understood the definitions (and thus responded)
similarly (Lombardi et al., 2016). It is also difficult to determine
whether subjects interpret the \emph{Remember} and \emph{Know} labels in
the same way that researchers intend (Umanath \& Coane, 2020),
especially as there is evidence to suggest participants struggle to
understand the distinction between the terms (Geraci, McCabe, \&
Guillory, 2009; Rubin \& Umanath, 2015; Williams \& Moulin, 2014).
Williams (2019) assessed the ways in which non-recollective subjective
experiences were defined to participants, and found a great deal of
inconsistency across a range of RK experiments. Some studies even
changed the \emph{Remember} and \emph{Know} labels altogether; many
exchanged the \emph{Know} label with \emph{Familiar} in an effort to
reduce subjects defaulting to colloquial understandings of the word
``know'' which typically indicate high certainty; e.g.~``I \textbf{know}
I saw this item in the study phase'' (Bastin, Van der Linden, Michel, \&
Friedman, 2004; Dobbins, KroU, \& Liu, 1998; Donaldson, Mackenzie, \&
Underhill, 1996; Ingram, Mickes, \& Wixted, 2012). Others also
substitute \emph{Remember} for \emph{Recollection} (Harlow, MacKenzie,
\& Donaldson, 2010). Labels that accurately match the processes they
intend to measure - \emph{Recollection} and \emph{Familiarity} - have
been proposed in an effort to reduce the potentially misleading effects
of the more colloquial \emph{Remember} and \emph{Know}, and thus make it
easier for participants to `map on' the definitions provided by
researchers (Harlow et al., 2010; Mayes, Montaldi, \& Migo, 2007).

~

In addition to the availability of different response options, and the
labels used to describe the underlying processes, there is evidence to
suggest that the format of to-be-remembered stimuli also plays a role in
obtained estimates of recollection and familiarity. The Picture
Superiority Effect (PSE) refers to a robust phenomenon whereby stimuli
presented as pictures are markedly better remembered on tests of recall
or recognition than stimuli presented as words (Shepard, 1967). There is
general agreement that, in recognition memory paradigms, picture
superiority manifests as enhanced recollection rather than familiarity
(Curran \& Doyle, 2011; Rajaram, 1996a). Word stimuli, on the other
hand, appear to produce increased familiarity ratings at test (Ally \&
Budson, 2007). Understanding this phenomenon could help to conceptualise
how memory breaks down in healthy ageing, and in the earliest stages of
amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). For example, Ally et al.
(2008) demonstrated that, despite similar levels of overall performance
on a recognition task, healthy older adults showed greater picture
superiority effects than younger adults. The memorial benefit of
pictures was indeed evident in both the young and older groups, but the
magnitude of this effect was greater in older adults, who only showed
worse performance when responding to word stimuli. Interestingly,
picture superiority also allows those with aMCI to show performance that
is comparable to healthy older adult controls; despite exhibiting
impaired performance overall, those with aMCI often show intact
familiarity processes when pictures are utilised in recognition memory
paradigms (and impaired familiarity when word stimuli are utilised;
Embree, Budson, \& Ally (2012); Ally et al. (2009a); Ally et al.
(2009b); Wolk, Signoff, \& DeKosky (2008); Algarabel et al. (2009);
Anderson et al. (2008); Hudon et al. (2009); O'Connor \& Ally (2010);
Serra et al. (2010); Westerberg et al. (2006){]}.

~

The objective of the current programme of research is to better
understand how different methodologies inform understandings about the
underlying processes of recollection and familiarity. Across a number of
experiments, the distinctiveness of to-be-remembered stimuli will be
systematically examined to determine the level at which successful
recognition is impacted, and which process(es) are most susceptible. The
aim of the first experiment, outlined below, is to establish baseline
PSE response patterns in a novel, modified RK paradigm. In a 2x3 mixed
factorial design, a within-subjects variable of stimulus type (words /
simple pictures) will be used to determine whether the magnitude of
picture superiority effects (PSEs) is mediated by the particular
response options available at test (between-subjects variable of
response option: RFG, RFBG, RF-Ratings). In each condition, the labels
\emph{Recollection}/\emph{Familiarity} will be used in place of the
standard \emph{Remember}/\emph{Know}, in an effort to reduce the impact
of colloquial understandings on the current experimental definitions. To
avoid guesses biasing estimations of familiarity (Belleville et al.,
2011; Eldridge et al., 2002; Larsson et al., 2006; Tunney \& Fernie,
2007; Williams, 2019), participants in all response-option conditions
are also given the option to report that they are merely \emph{Guessing}
that an item is old. At test, subjects will be presented with either i)
three response options (RFG); ii) four response options (RFBG; where a
\emph{Both} response option allows subjects to report the co-occurrence
of R and F; iii) separate 0-5 rating scales for R and F (where subjects
could report either process occurring alone, both processes occurring
conjointly, or that they are guessing by providing a `0' rating on both
scales). To establish whether a PSE is evident in the current paradigm,
\emph{d'} (d-prime) scores will be calculated for each participant.
\emph{d'} is a signal detection statistic, calculated by taking the
standardised difference between the signal (i.e.~correct hits) and
signal+noise (i.e.~false alarms); in other words, \emph{d'} offers a
representation of global recognition performance and participants'
ability to distinguish target items from lures (Wixted, 2014). Higher
\emph{d'} scores demonstrate better overall performance on the memory
task. Based on the discussed research, the following results are
hypothesised:

A total of 186 subjects completed the online experiment (\emph{M} = 26.7
years (\emph{SD} = 10.36 years; see Table 1 for a comprehensive
breakdown of the sample). The current sample was primarily comprised of
participants sourced from voluntary participation websites such as
\href{https://www.prolific.co/}{Prolific Academic} (52.15\%) (where they
received payment at the rate of Â£5/hr) and via the in-school
\href{https://keelepsychology.sona-systems.com/}{research participation system}
(where they received course participation credits; 41.4\%). A small
number of participants were also recruited from social media and other
online sources (Facebook: 3.76\%; Call For Participants: 1.61\%; Reddit:
0.54\%; unspecified: 0.54\%). To meet our YA requirements, all
participants were required to be between 18-59 years of age (actual
range: 18-59). As our experiment involved English word stimuli, we also
asked subjects whether English was their first language; the vast
majority (93.01\%) reported that English was indeed their first
language.

Pictures of innocuous, everyday objects (e.g.~clock, rabbit, shoe) and
their written-word names were sourced from Rossion \& Pourtois (2004).
The picture stimuli consisted of greyscale line-drawn illustrations
(containing shaded surface details), while word stimuli were simply the
written-word names of each object presented in a clear Sans-serif
typeface. A total of 136 unique items were randomly selected for use in
the current experiment, from a pool consisting of: i) items with a
written name between 4 and 7 letters; ii) items that would conjure the
same intended concept in our UK-based sample (e.g.~``ladder'' should be
universally understood across English-speaking cultures, whereas
``wagon'' or ``pants'' can be interpreted differently); iii) items that
were not unknown, or uncommon, for our sample (e.g.~Americanisms such as
``wrench''); and iv) non-specific concepts such as ``bird'' (since the
pool of items already contained specific exemplars of birds, such as
``peacock'' and ``penguin''). As the current experiment involved
memorising word stimuli, a single item (``glass'') was also removed as
it shared too many letters with another item (``glasses''). Selected
items were split into four separate lists for counterbalancing purposes;
using the normative data provided by Rossion \& Pourtois (2004), each
list was balanced based on the length of the written name, as well as
scores of naming accuracy, familiarity, visual complexity, and mental
imagery agreement. A series of independent samples t-tests confirmed
that no list was significantly different from another on any of the
aforementioned criteria.

The picture stimuli utilised in the current study were created in
Photoshop CC (20.0.04 Release), by importing the greyscale,
surface-shaded, line-drawings onto a plain 250x250px white canvas.
Written word stimuli were created using the Calibri sans-serif typeface
on the same size canvas (see Figure 1 for example stimuli). All items
were exported as .pngs files for presentation by the online survey
platform.

The current study utilised a mixed design, with a 2-level
within-subjects factor of stimuli format (words, drawings), and a
3-level between-subjects factor of response option (RFG, RFBG,
RF-Ratings). Subjects completed two study blocks - one consisting only
of word stimuli, the other consisting only of picture stimuli - before
completing a single mixed format recognition test, where previously
studied word and picture items were randomly shown among new, unseen
items. Subjects passed through 2 levels of blocked randomization during
the experiment (equally sized, predetermined blocks). First, subjects
were randomly allocated into one of two study block orders, which
determined the order in which they were presented with the picture and
word blocks at study. Second, subjects were assigned into one of three
possible recognition tests (identical aside from the response options
available when categorising recognition experiences): 1) RFG:
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'',``Guessing''; 2) RFBG:
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'', ``Guessing'', ``Both'', or 3)
RF-Ratings: two independent 0-5 rating scales to separately report the
contribution of Recollection and Familiarity. These randomisation
processes were completed automatically by the experiment software using
balanced methods.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\paragraph{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Data collection was conducted via the online survey platform
\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/}{Qualtrics}. Subjects initially
completed an encoding block, where target words and pictures were
randomly presented one-at-a-time on-screen. To ensure attention was
directed to the presented stimuli, participants were required to respond
to a simple encoding question toward each item at study: ``Is this a
picture or a word?''. This question allowed for the assessment of
performance during the study block (to determine whether participants
were concentrating at study), whilst also avoiding potential
levels-of-processing effects that can accompany deeper encoding
judgements (e.g.~pleasantness ratings). The encoding phase was followed
by a short distractor task comprised of 20 multiplication sums. Finally,
subjects completed the recognition task, where they were again randomly
presented with word and picture items one-at-a-time on-screen, and were
required to respond \emph{Old}/\emph{New} depending on whether they
recognised the item or not. \emph{Old} responses were succeeded by a
follow-up screen whereby participants were asked to report their
recognition experience for the current item; the response options
available during this follow-up response page differed between
participants, with random allocation into either the RFG, RFBG, or
RF-Ratings response option conditions. Recollection and Familiarity were
defined identically across conditions, and the only deviations in
instructions were: i) to define the additional ``Both'' response option
in the RFBG condition; and ii) explain how certain responses should be
reported in the RF-Ratings condition (i.e.~subjects could still report a
``Guess'' in this condition by providing a 0-rating on both of the
scales).

\hypertarget{data-processing}{%
\paragraph{Data processing}\label{data-processing}}

Measured variables included the total number of hits and FAs, and the
total number of hits and FAs assigned to each of the available response
options (RFG, RFBG, and RF Ratings). In order to create a common
dependant variable, proportions were calculated from these variables in
slightly different ways depending on the response option group. In the
RFG-judgement group, simple proportions were created from the total
number of R responses and the total number of F responses. In the RFBG
condition, similar proportions were calculated by separately adding the
proportion of Both responses to the proportion of R and proportion of F
responses. In the RF-Ratings group, proportions of R and F were
calculated based on the number of responses scoring +\textgreater3; a
response was classified R when subjects rated between 3-5 on the
``Recollection'' scale (regardless of the Familiarity rating), and a
response was classified F when subjects rated between 3-5 on the
``Familiarity'' scale (regardless of the Recollection rating). The
scales therefore allowed for pure R responses (R=3-5 + F=0-2), pure F
responses (F=3-5 + R=0-2), both responses (R=3-5 + F=3-5) and Guessing
responses (R=0 + F=0). Additional DVs included: i) d' (d-prime, a signal
detection measure of sensitivity); ii) c-value (a measure of response
bias); iii) overall accuracy (hits / (hits + FAs)); iv) reaction times
for all responses.

All analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020). \emph{d'}
(sensitivity) and \emph{c} (bias) scores were calculated using the
`psycho' package (v0.5.0; Makowski, 2018). \emph{d'} scores were
calculated via: z-scores for correct hits minus z-scores for false
alarms (Hautus, 1995 adjustments for extreme values were applied).
\emph{c} scores were calculated

A series of exclusion criteria were defined before analysis. First,
subjects were to be excluded from analysis if they showed poor
performance during the encoding task; the relative ease of reporting
whether each item was shown as a word or picture prompted a performance
cut off of 90\% accuracy. This would allow for some accidental clicks,
though subjects scoring less than 90\% were to be excluded on the
assumption they did not dedicate their full attention to the task.
Second, subjects would be considered outliers (and thus excluded from
analysis) if they presented extreme z-scores of +/- 3 for total hits,
total FAs, or overall recognition (hits minus FAs). However, no subjects
were found to meet any of these criteria.

To establish baseline picture superiority effects in the current

availability of different response options at test, a series of 2
(stimuli format: words, pictures) x 3 (response option condition:
RFG-judgements, RFBG-judgements, RF-ratings) mixed ANOVAs were conducted
on a number of outcome variables. Namely, the signal detection measures
of \emph{d'} (sensitivity) and \emph{c} (decision criterion), as well as
the proportion of overall hits, false alarms (FAs), and overall
recognition (hits - FAs) {[}see Table 2{]}. Significant main effects and
interaction effects were followed-up with Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise
comparisons.

The ANOVA on \emph{d'} scores demonstrated a significant main effect of
stimuli-format, \(F(1, 183) = 295.80\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.18\),
\(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .223\); a PSE was evident, with
pictures (\(M = 1.62\)) producing significantly better discrimination
between hits and FAs than words (\(M = 0.86\)), \(t(183) = -17.20\),
\(p < .001\). The ANOVAs on the proportion of hits, FAs, and overall
recognition also produced findings consistent with a PSE. For hits,
there was a significant main effect of stimuli-format,
\(F(1, 183) = 131.77\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.01\), \(p < .001\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .092\), with pictures (\(M = 0.62\)) showing a higher
number of overall hits compared to words (\(M = 0.47\)),
\(t(183) = -11.48\), \(p < .001\). Similarly, the ANOVA on the
proportion of FAs showed a significant main effect of stimuli-format
\(F(1, 183) = 61.18\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.01\), \(p < .001\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .084\), with words (\(M = 0.21\)) producing more FAs
than pictures (\(M = 0.12\)), \(t(183) = 7.82\), \(p < .001\). Overall
recognition performance (a measure that takes into account both hits and
FAs) offered further support for a PSE in the current paradigm; a
significant main effect of stimuli-format \(F(1, 183) = 409.20\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.01\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .236\) showed
pictures (\(M = 0.50\)) produced better overall recognition on the task
compared to words (\(M = 0.27\)), \(t(183) = -20.23\), \(p < .001\).
Finally, \emph{c} scores showed no significant main effect of
stimuli-format, \(F(1, 183) = 2.31\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.11\),
\(p = .130\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .002\), suggesting response biases were
similarly conservative between pictures and words. No interaction
effects were found between stimuli format and response option for any of
the variables.

Taken together, the findings demonstrate a replication of the PSE in the
current memory paradigm, and suggest stimuli format plays a key role in
memorability that is independent from the particular response options
available to participants. The current findings support the hypotheses
of a PSE manifesting as i) higher overall d' scores for pictures
compared to words, ii) a higher proportion of correct hits, iii) lower
proportion of false alarms, and iv) better overall recognition.

To determine the impact of stimuli format on the rates of R and F,
additional 2 (words, pictures) x 3 (RFG-judgements, RFBG-judgements,
RF-ratings) mixed ANOVAs were conducted on the mean proportion of hits
(see Figure 2) and FAs (see Figure 3) assigned R, F, and G.

\textbf{\emph{Recollection:}} For R hits, there was a significant main
effect of stimuli-format, \(F(1, 178) = 158.42\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.03\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .167\);
pictures (\(M = 0.67\)) showed a higher proportion of Recollected hits
than words (\(M = 0.45\)), . For R FAs, there was no significant main
effect of stimuli-format, \(F(1, 136) = 2.78\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.04\),
\(p = .098\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .005\). There were no significant
interaction effects between stimuli format and response option condition
for R hits or FAs.

\textbf{\emph{Familiarity:}} For F hits, there was a significant
interaction between stimuli format and response option,
\(F(2, 178) = 34.42\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.03\), \(p < .001\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .083\) (see Figure 4). Words resulted in more
Familiarity hits than pictures in both the RFG group (words:
\(M = 0.48\); pictures: \(M = 0.29\), \(t(178) = 6.07\), \(p < .001\))
and RFBG group (words: \(M = 0.57\); pictures: \(M = 0.48\),
\(t(178) = 2.87\), \(p = .005\)). Conversely, pictures (\(M = 0.79\))
resulted in more Familiarity hits than words (\(M = 0.63\)) in the
RF-Ratings group, \(t(178) = -5.29\), \(p < .001\). The ANOVA on
Familiarity FAs did not yield any significant results; with no
significant main effect of stimuli-format, \(F(1, 136) = 1.12\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.04\), \(p = .292\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .002\) or
significant interaction effects, \(F(2, 136) = 1.12\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.04\), \(p = .331\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .004\).

\textbf{\emph{Guessing:}} The ANOVA on Guessing hits also showed a
significant interaction between stimuli format and response
option,\(F(2, 178) = 4.17\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.01\), \(p = .017\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .011\), (see Figure 5). Words resulted in more
Guessing hits than pictures in both the RFG group (words: \(M = 0.17\);
pictures: \(M = 0.08\)), \(t(178) = 5.38\), \(p < .001\); and the RFBG
group (words: \(M = 0.16\); pictures: \(M = 0.09\)), \(t(178) = 4.42\),
\(p < .001\). There was no difference in the number of Guessing hits
between words \(M = 0.04\) and pictures \(M = 0.01\) in the RF-Ratings
group, \(t(178) = 1.51\), \(p = .133\). For Guessing FAs, there was no
significant main effect of stimuli-format or significant interaction
effects.

Such findings mostly support the proposed hypotheses. Pictures indeed
produced a higher proportion of R hits in comparison to words, though no
picture superiority was evident in the number of R FAs. This suggests
that, despite words showing a decreased level of memorability compared
to pictures, they do not elicit high certainty false recognition at any
higher rate. Words also produced a higher proportion of F hits compared
to pictures, as predicted, but only in the RFG and RFBG conditions. It
is unclear why the same pattern was not evident in the RF-Ratings group,
aside from the possibility that participants avoided the more complex
ratings screen (and instead more often chose \emph{New}, inaccurately),
unless they had a high certainty of their recognition (as evidenced for
R hits). Again, there was no evidence of picture superiority in regard
to the number of F FAs. The hypotheses put forward for G responses were
again mostly supported; there were more guesses made toward words than
pictures, however, this again only applied to the RFG and RFBG
conditions. Such findings align with the possible explanation outlined
above, whereby participants avoided having to provide two separate
ratings unless they were very certain they recognised the item.

\hypertarget{pse-and-the-availability-of-different-response-options}{%
\paragraph{PSE and the availability of different response
options:}\label{pse-and-the-availability-of-different-response-options}}

To determine whether the availability of different options had an impact
on picture superiority within the current paradigm, the main effects of
response option were also examined in the aforementioned ANOVAs.
Discriminability (\emph{d'}) between hits and FAs showed no significant
main effect of response option, supporting the hypothesis that a PSE
would be evident in each of the response option conditions. Response
bias (\emph{c}) scores did show a main effect of response option though,
\(F(2, 183) = 6.44\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.51\), \(p = .002\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .054\); those in the RF-Ratings condition
(\(M = 0.67\)) showed higher c-scores (and thus a more conservative
response bias) than those in the RFG condition (\(M = 0.34\)),
\(t(183) = -3.59\), \(p = .001\). This indicates subjects were less
likely to respond \emph{Old} when they were required to provide more
detailed follow-up recognition judgements (i.e., using separate 0-5
scales for R and F), compared to simply selecting one of three options
(R,F, or G). This again supports the notion of avoidance from
participants when they were required to provide two separate ratings.
The ANOVAs on the proportion of hits, FAs, and overall recognition also
mostly supported our hypothesis that a PSE would be evident in each of
the response option conditions. While the ANOVAs on the proportion of
FAs and overall recognition showed no significant main effects of
response option, there was a significant main effect for the proportion
of hits, \(F(2, 183) = 6.46\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.09\), \(p = .002\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .057\), with the RFG group (\(M = 0.62\)) showing
more hits than the RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.48\)), \(t(183) = 3.60\),
\(p = .001\). This unexpected result may also reflect the conservative
response bias of those in the RF-Ratings group, whereby fewer total
\emph{Old} responses necessitates fewer hits as a result. However, a
lack of differences between groups for FAs and overall recognition
indicates a comparable PSE across each of the response option groups.

With regard to rates of R and F, there was a significant main effect of
response-option for R hits, \(F(2, 178) = 8.55\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.09\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .069\); the
RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.65\)) showed significantly more R hits
compared to both the RFG-group (\(M = 0.49\)), , and the RFBG-group
(\(M = 0.54\)), . R FA's also exhibited an identical pattern; a
significant main effect of response-option, \(F(2, 136) = 10.70\),
\(\mathit{MSE} = 0.12\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .106\), showed
that those in the RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.38\)) produced more
Recollection FAs than both the RFG-group (\(M = 0.14\)), , and
RFBG-group (\(M = 0.24\)), ). These findings align with those above to
suggest a more conservative response bias in the RF-Ratings group;
participants were more likely to respond \emph{Old} in the RF-Ratings
condition when they experienced high certainty in their recognition -
regardless of whether or not that recognition was accurate or false.

~

The significant interaction for F hits showed that word stimuli produced
significantly more F hits in the RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.63\))
compared to the RFG group (\(M = 0.48\)), \(t(276.78) = -3.37\),
\(p = .002\). An identical pattern was also observed for pictures
between the RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.79\)) and RFG group
(\(M = 0.29\)), \(t(276.78) = -11.13\), \(p < .001\), however, F hits in
the RF-Ratings group were also higher than the RFBG group (\(M = 0.48\))
when the stimuli were pictures, \(t(276.78) = -6.94\), \(p < .001\). The
RFBG group (\(M = 0.48\)) also showed a significantly higher number of F
hits compared to the RFG group (\(M = 0.29\)), \(t(276.78) = -4.24\),
\(p < .001\). There was no significant main effect of response-option
for F FAs. Such findings suggest that the proportion of F responses
increases when participants are given the option to report \emph{Both} -
either explicitly, or from rating high on both rating scales.

~

Finally, the significant interaction for G hits demonstrated that word
stimuli produced significantly fewer G hits in the RF-Ratings group
(\(M = 0.04\)) compared to both the RFG group (\(M = 0.17\)),
\(t(281.42) = 5.44\), \(p < .001\), and the RFBG group (\(M = 0.16\)),
\(t(281.42) = 5.18\), \(p < .001\). Likewise, pictures also produced
significantly fewer G hits in the RF-Ratings group (\(M = 0.01\))
compared to both the RFG group (\(M = 0.08\)), \(t(281.42) = 2.70\),
\(p = .020\) and RFBG group (\(M = 0.09\)), \(t(281.42) = 3.15\),
\(p = .005\). For G FAs, a significant main effect of response-option,
\(F(2, 136) = 15.69\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.11\), \(p < .001\),
\(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .144\) revealed that the RF-ratings group
(\(M = 0.08\)) again showed significantly fewer G FAs than both the RFG
(\(M = 0.35\)), , and RFBG groups (\(M = 0.30\)), . These findings again
align with the previous results that suggest those in the RF-Ratings
group responded conservatively overall, and were less likely to respond
\emph{Old} than the other groups unless they felt a high level of
certainty.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsubsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The aim of the current study was to establish baseline PSE response
patterns in a novel, modified RK paradigm. Substituting the classic
\emph{Remember} / \emph{Know} labels for \emph{Recollection} /
\emph{Familiarity}, recognition for words and pictures was tested across
three separate response option conditions (RFG, RFBG, RF-Ratings).
Analysis of the behavioural data demonstrated a clear Picture
Superiority Effect (PSE) in the current paradigm, with picture stimuli
showing better discrimination, a higher number of overall hits, lower
number of FAs, and better overall recognition performance than words.
Taken together, these findings are consistent with the notion that
pictures offer an enhanced memorability in comparison to words. When
word stimuli were correctly identified, they were not recognised in the
the same context-rich nature as pictures, evidenced by a higher
proportion of F responses. The current findings also align with those
from previous studies, with pictures showing enhanced recollection
(Curran \& Doyle, 2011; Rajaram, 1996a) and words showing enhanced
familiarity (Ally \& Budson, 2007). While most of the proposed
hypotheses were supported, there were some unexpected results. Stimuli
format had no effect on the obtained proportions of FAs; regardless of
whether FAs were assigned R or F, there was no evidence of picture
superiority. This finding does not refute the notion of a PSE in the
current paradigm - the memorial advantage of pictures over words is
evident, but it instead indicates that stimuli without this advantage
(i.e.~words) may produce more misses, but not increased levels of false
recognition.

Many of the unexpected results are centred around the RF-Ratings
response option condition. Word stimuli were hypothesised to produce
more Familiarity and Guessing hits than pictures, since it was expected
that they would not be recognised in the the same context-rich nature as
pictures. This result was indeed obtained in both the RFG and RFBG
response-option conditions, however, the RF-Ratings did not produce the
same finding (no difference between stimuli formats was observed).
Similarly, while the RFG and RFBG conditions showed comparable
proportions of hits and levels of response bias (\emph{c} scores), the
RF-Ratings group again produced different findings, showing
significantly fewer hits and significantly higher \emph{c} scores (and
thus a more conservative response bias) compared to the RFG group. As
the proportion of hits and mean \emph{c} scores were not significantly
different between the RF-Ratings and RFBG response option groups, it
indicates that these results may be attributable to participants having
the ability to report that they experience \emph{Both} recollection and
familiarity processes conjointly. However, as performance differences
were most notable in the RF-Ratings condition, it suggests these
findings are attributable to the increased task complexity from RFG to
RFBG, and RFBG to RF-Ratings. The option to report \emph{Both} may be
confusing to participants, especially to those who struggle to
understand the distinction between recollection and familiarity to begin
with (Geraci et al., 2009; Rubin \& Umanath, 2015; Williams \& Moulin,
2014). Providing the \emph{Both} option in the form of two scales may
exacerbate this confusion further, and thus lead to results that are
significantly different from the condition with the least complexity
(RFG). Such a hypothesis is supported by a number of other findings.
First, the more conservative response bias exhibited by those in the
RF-Ratings group demonstrates how subjects were less likely to respond
\emph{Old} when they were required to provide more detailed follow-up
recognition judgements (i.e., using separate 0-5 scales for R and F),
compared to simply selecting one of three options (R,F, or G). Second,
despite \emph{Guessing} responses being permissible in any of the
response-option groups, participants were significantly less likely to
report a guess when two independent ratings were required - a finding
evident from the reduced number of \emph{Guessing} hits and FAs compared
to the other response option conditions. Third, the RF-Ratings group
showed significantly more R hits and R FAs compared to both the
RFG-group and the RFBG-groups, indicating participants were more likely
to respond \emph{Old} in the RF-Ratings condition when they experienced
high certainty in their recognition - regardless of whether or not that
recognition was accurate or false. Taken together, these findings all
support the notion of a certain level of avoidance from participants
when they were required to provide more detailed reports of their
recognition.

Establishing baseline PSEs in the current paradigm is important for
allowing further experimental manipulations in the experiments that
follow. While the independent ratings paradigm proposed by Higham \&
Vokey (2004) is undoubtedly useful in the discussion around the most
effective methods of measuring recollection and familiarity, it does not
suit the needs of current programme of research going forward, where
comparisons between different stimuli formats is the primary concern. In
the current experiment, picture stimuli consisted of simple greyscale
illustrations (Rossion \& Pourtois, 2004), though the extent to which
stimuli of increasing levels of detail impacts recognition is unclear.
The distinctiveness of to-be-remembered stimuli will be systematically
compared across a number of experiments, following the conception of a
new set of detailed realistic photograph stimuli. Following the unique
results obtained from the RF-Ratings group in the current experiment, it
is likely that this condition would exhibit further differences if
included in the proposed experiments, which may become difficult to
interpret when further stimuli formats are introduced. The current
findings to suggest avoidant response patterns in the RF-Ratings group
further highlight the unique results this condition might produce.
Therefore, only the RFG and RFBG response option conditions will be
taken forward into the proposed recognition experiments that focus on
comparisons of stimuli distinctiveness.

\hypertarget{chapter-3}{%
\section{Chapter 3}\label{chapter-3}}

The Picture Superiority Effect (PSE) is a highly robust and replicable
phenomenon. In recognition memory paradigms, the PSE has been shown to
manifest as both increased recollection and familiarity (Dewhurst \&
Conway, 1994; Rajaram, 1993, 1996b; Wagner, Gabrieli, \& Verfaellie,
1997; Yonelinas, 2002). The effect is present in children, adolescents
and healthy older adults (Whitehouse, Maybery, \& Durkin, 2006), though
perhaps more striking is the fact that patients with Alzheimer's disease
or those presenting early isolated memory impairments, known as amnestic
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), also show memorial benefits toward
pictures (Ally, 2012). This is supported by ERP studies demonstrating
comparable enhancements to recollection-based ERP components between
healthy older and aMCI groups when pictures, rather than words, are
utilised (Ally et al., 2009a). There is debate within the literature
attempting to characterise the nature of memory deficits in aMCI,
whereby despite general agreement that recollection processes are
impaired in such individuals, findings show great inconsistency with
regard to familiarity (Algarabel et al., 2012; Belleville et al., 2011;
Pitarque, 2016; Wolk, Dunfee, Dickerson, Aizenstein, \& DeKosky, 2011;
Wolk, Mancuso, Kliot, Arnold, \& Dickerson, 2013). The PSE may have been
largely overlooked as an area for further research in an effort to help
settle this debate, despite recent reviews highlighting methodological
differences across studies as the potential source of inconsistent
findings (Koen \& Yonelinas, 2014; Migo et al., 2012; Schoemaker et al.,
2014). The level at which stimuli distinctiveness impacts successful
recognition is currently unclear, and there is little consistency across
studies with regard to what is considered a `picture'.

Many experiments utilise illustrations for their picture stimuli (van
der Meulen et al., 2012; Westerberg et al., 2013; Wolk et al., 2011),
with a standardised set of items published by Snodgrass \& Vanderwart
(1980) among the most-used illustrated picture stimuli within the domain
of memory research (BermÃºdez-Margaretto, BeltrÃ¡n, Cuetos, \& DomÃ­nguez,
2018; Deason, Hussey, Flannery, \& Ally, 2015; Hockley, 2008; Martins \&
Lloyd-Jones, 2006; McBride \& Anne Dosher, 2002; Meade, Ahmad, \&
Fernandes, 2019; Schmitter-Edgecombe, Woo, \& Greeley, 2009; van der
Meulen et al., 2012; Wagner et al., 1997; Wammes, Meade, \& Fernandes,
2016; Weldon, Iii, \& Challis, 1989; Weldon \& Roediger, 1987;
Whitehouse et al., 2006). The set consists of 260 line drawings of
common, everyday objects (in black ink), along with their written word
counterpart (e.g.~``shoe''). Items were selected on the basis of
exemplifying a number of semantic categories, including animals,
furniture, fruit, etc., and a range of normative data was collected for
each item; indices of naming agreement, mental imagery agreement, visual
complexity, and familiarity were all recorded for each drawing. The
normative data for the Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980) items has been
continually revisited, with a number of studies gathering
culturally-appropriate norms (e.g.~in Spanish (Sanfeliu \& Fernandez,
1996), Chinese (Yoon et al., 2004), and Russian (Tsaparina, Bonin, \&
MÃ©ot, 2011), and additional testing of the relationship between reaction
time and naming agreement (SzÃ©kely et al., 2003). There are multiple
theories of object recognition; the recognition-by-components theory
proposed by Biederman (1987) identifies shape as the most crucial factor
for successful recognition, in which case, the object outlines found in
the set by Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980) should be more than sufficient
for experimental cognitive research. Other theories, however, posit that
surface details such as colour and texture are just as crucial in
forming object representations (Tanaka, Weiskopf, \& Williams, 2001;
Tarr \& BÃ¼lthoff, 1998). The wide-ranging applicability of the Snodgrass
\& Vanderwart (1980) items throughout a number of cognitive disciplines
has led to a more recent revision of the items by Rossion \& Pourtois
(2004). This revision consists of the exact same objects, digitally
re-drawn to include surface textures and shading. Additionally, this set
provides greyscale and colour versions for all items, as opposed to the
greyscale-only items found in the Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980) set
(see Figure 6 for example items contained in the Snodgrass \& Vanderwart
(1980) and Rossion \& Pourtois (2004) stimuli sets). The Rossion \&
Pourtois (2004) revision now appears to be favoured over the original
Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980) set among many cognitive researchers
(Rollins \& Riggins, 2018, p. @ensor2019b; Stenberg, 2006; Wolk et al.,
2008), almost certainly attributable to the increased detail and ability
to choose whether colour is a necessary condition.

Despite their widespread use, line drawings have been criticised for
their relative simplicity and lack of realism (Viggiano, Vannucci, \&
Righi (2004)), with many researchers favouring the use of photographs as
experimental stimuli (Embree et al., 2012; Pitarque, 2016; Troyer et
al., 2012; Troyer, Vandermorris, \& Murphy, 2016; P. Wang et al., 2013).
Photographs of faces are especially useful in research examining emotion
and face recognition (Barba, 1997; Bowen, Fields, \& Kensinger, 2019;
Cui et al., 2016; Herzmann, Minor, \& Curran, 2018), though a number of
common-object photograph sets have also emerged as ecological
alternatives to line-drawn items (Adlington, Laws, \& Gale, 2009;
Moreno-MartÃ­nez \& Montoro, 2012; Viggiano et al., 2004). While the
published sets of photographs are undoubtedly useful in a range of
cognitive domains, they do not allow us to specifically examine stimuli
format as a factor on its own, as the concepts depicted are unique to
the set they derive from. In order to make such comparisons, and ensure
any differences in performance (e.g.~recognition memory ability) are
indeed attributable to stimuli format, the objects depicted must be
consistent across stimuli formats. The current study presents a new set
of photographic stimuli that extend the set of words and drawings
provided by Rossion \& Pourtois (2004), wherein each of the concepts
depicted has been carefully matched across formats. These new stimuli
will be utilised throughout a number of planned recognition experiments
that aim to systematically compare measures of recognition against
different `levels' of stimuli. The curation of a new set of photographs
- carefully matched to other formats - allows investigation into whether
picture superiority magnitudes are mediated by the format pictures are
presented in. The inconsistent use of different formats across studies
has previously made it difficult to reconcile effects obtained in
response to drawings with those obtained in response to photographs - an
inherent problem when concepts are not matched across format. Normative
data for the new set of photographs is also presented, allowing others
who also wish to use our photograph stimuli to filter items by measures
of naming agreement, mental imagery agreement, familiarity, visual
complexity, and colour diagnosticity.

A total of 377 subjects completed the online experiment (see Table 3 for
a breakdown of the gender and age of the sample). This sample size
provided 20 data points for each of the five response types, while also
ensuring the experiment did not last too long for participants (approx
25-mins). Subjects were recruited from both voluntary participation
websites such as \href{https://www.prolific.co/}{Prolific Academic}
(where they received payment at the rate of Â£5/hr), and via the
in-school
\href{https://keelepsychology.sona-systems.com/}{research participation system}
(where they received course participation credits).

To meet our YA requirements, all participants were required to be aged
between 18-59 years (actual obtained range: 18-59 years). As our
experiment involved typing the English labels for a range of image
stimuli, subjects were also asked whether English was their first
language; all but one participant indicated that English was indeed
their first language (99.2\%).

\hypertarget{materials-1}{%
\paragraph{Materials}\label{materials-1}}

A pool of 136 line drawings (Rossion \& Pourtois, 2004) - depicting
common, everyday objects - were brought forward from the previous
experiment. These items (along with their written-word labels) would
form two of the unique stimuli formats that would be used in future
recognition experiments (words and drawings). In this study, the
drawings from Rossion \& Pourtois (2004) were simply used as a reference
in the photograph matching process. Corresponding photographs were
obtained online with the aim of depicting the everyday objects in a
similar manner to the drawings. The inherent subjectivity involved in
this process may have led to images that were not a reliable `match' to
the concepts they were selected to depict (for example, the photograph
chosen to depict the concept ``bottle'' may inadvertently provoke the
majority of participants to give the label ``wine'', thus indicating
that this particular photograph fails to accurately depict the intended
concept). To address this issue, and ensure all photographs more
objectively depict the same concepts as the line drawings, three
different photograph variations were found for each everyday object,
with the aim of taking the best `match' forward. An emphasis was placed
on variety across these variations, with the aim of obtaining at least
one photograph that very closely resembled the line-drawn depiction, and
another offering a more modern depiction. Some items were substituted
due to unique restrictions that meant they could not easily be
translated into photographic format (for example, the shapes ``arrow''
and ``star'' can not be represented similarly as photographs). Photo
stimuli were obtained by searching open-source, copyright-free image
websites (e.g.~\href{https://unsplash.com/}{Unsplash};
\href{https://www.pexels.com/}{Pexels}) for photographs that depicted
the same everyday objects as the line drawings (see Appendix B for the
full list of image references).

The matching process produced a total of 408 unique photographs. All
were imported into Adobe Photoshop (20.0.04 Release), where the
background was removed to isolate the object of interest from other
potentially distracting visual details. This was completed manually
using the magnetic lasso and polygonal lasso tools (edges were either
feathered by 1px or left un-feathered). The orientation of isolated
objects was adjusted to ensure they matched as closely as possible with
their line-drawn counterpart (e.g.~all photograph variations of the item
`boot' were adjusted so the toe was facing left and the heel facing
right, as in the line drawing); this was often achieved by flipping or
mirroring the object to `correct' the direction.

Despite isolating objects from their background, a small number of
photographs still contained irrelevant and potentially distracting
details. For example, in one photograph variation of the item `piano',
there was a sign on the object that may have impacted how the item was
named or rated. Such details were removed as best as possible using the
clone stamp and content-aware fill tools. Any obvious text (e.g.~brand
names) and numbers were also removed from photographs using the same
method (see Figure 8). The primary aim of the current study was to
obtain photographs that could be clearly distinguished as a unique
stimuli format among words and line drawings; it is conceivable that
combining these formats (i.e.~inadvertently including photographs that
also contain written words) might affect recognition performance in ways
that are not directly comparable to items defined only by a single
category. Any text in our photographs was therefore removed, apart from
a couple of exceptions whereby such details happened to be integral to
the depiction of the object (e.g.~the numbers found on a ruler or
clock).

All photographs were exported from Photoshop in ``.png'' format in both
their original colour and in greyscale (by setting saturation levels to
0). Final edits were completed in Adobe Lightroom (Classic, 8.2
Release): exposure (brightness) adjustments were made on images that
appeared too light or too dark; highlights were decreased if some areas
were too bright compared to the rest of the photograph; shadows were
raised if some areas were too dark compared to the rest of the
photograph; noise reduction was applied to some items after isolating
the subject had inadvertently made unwanted noise/grain more visible.
The changes made to each image were systematically applied to both the
colour and greyscale versions (e.g.~if one variation of ``shoe'' had an
exposure increase of .010 for the colour version, the greyscale version
also received an exposure increase of .010). Some colour-specific
adjustments were made to the colour photographs only, however; common
photo artefacts such as chromatic aberration (purple fringing) were
corrected, along with white balance normalisation. Finally, all
photographs were placed on a 600x600 pixel white background, and made to
fill this frame as much as possible (i.e.~some items were restrained by
height, whilst others were restrained by width).

\hypertarget{design-1}{%
\paragraph{Design}\label{design-1}}

This was a descriptive study; a mix of qualitative and quantitative data
were gathered. Across three blocks, all participants provided five types
of response toward photograph stimuli: i) Naming; ii) Familiarity; iii)
Visual Complexity, iv) Colour Diagnosticity; and v) Mental Imagery
Agreement. Excluding the Naming task (consisting of a typed single-word
answer), all responses were provided on a 5-point ordinal scale. Within
participants, the maximum number of response type provided for any one
item was two; Naming and Familiarity responses were paired in one block,
Visual Complexity and Colour Diagnosticity responses were paired in
another, and Mental Imagery Agreement responses were always presented in
a separate block. The order of these three blocks was counterbalanced
across participants. Toward each individual photograph, participants
made only one or two types of response before moving on to the next
item, and the same items were not repeated to participants. For each
photograph, the five types of required data were obtained by
counterbalancing between participants (e.g.~for the first variation of
the ``cat'' photograph, the Naming and Familiarity data was obtained
from one participant, the Visual Complexity and Colour Diagnosticity
data was obtained from another, and the Mental Imagery Agreement data
was obtained from another).

\hypertarget{procedure-1}{%
\paragraph{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}}

Data collection was conducted via two online platforms; i)
\href{https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/}{Qualtrics} - a survey platform that
allowed for straightforward collection of consent, demographics, and
computer compatibility data, and ii)
\href{https://pavlovia.org/}{Pavlovia} - an open-source experiment
hosting platform for studies programmed in Javascript (Peirce et al.,
2019).

In the Naming and Familiarity block, participants were first asked
``What is the name of the item depicted?''. Subjects were instructed to
name each photograph as briefly and unambiguously as possible, with one
name only, and respond by typing their answer into the response box. If
they did not know the name of an item, or had a tip-of-the-tongue
experience, participants were instructed to type ``no'' for their answer
(the term ``don't know'' was avoided so as not to encourage subjects to
deviate from single-word responses, as instructed).Following the naming
judgement, with the same photograph still present on-screen,
participants were next asked ``How familiar is the item depicted?''.
Subjects were instructed to judge each photo according to how usual or
unusual the item was in their realm of experience; specifically,
familiarity was defined as ``the degree to which you come in contact
with, or think about, the concept'', and encouraged participants to rate
the concept itself rather than the particular way it was currently
shown. Participants selected one value from the 5-point scale, ranging
from very unfamiliar (1) to very familiar (5), and were encouraged to
use the full range of the scale throughout the set of photographs.

In the Visual Complexity and Colour Diagnosticity block, participants
were first instructed to respond to the question ``How visually complex
is this picture?'' using a 5-point scale that ranged from ``very
simple'' (1) to ``very complex'' (5). Complexity was defined to subjects
as ``the amount of detail in the picture''; in contrast to the
familiarity ratings, participants were encouraged here to rate the
complexity of the picture itself, rather than the real-life item. If the
photograph shown was greyscale, subjects would simply move on to the
next item. If the item shown was in colour, however, participants were
also required to make a colour diagnosticity judgement. This concept was
defined as ``how typical / normal the colour of the item is'',
instructing subjects to rate on a 5-point scale ranging from ``Not at
all diagnostic (i.e.~this item could be in any other colour equally
well)'' (1) to "Highly diagnostic (i.e.~this item appears only in this
colour in real life). Participants were instructed to utilise the full
range of options on the scale when making visual complexity and colour
diagnosticity judgements. After making these ratings, a fixation cross
was presented during a 1s interstimulus interval.

Due to the slight change in procedure and increased task complexity,
Mental Imagery Agreement ratings were always acquired in an individual
block (i.e.~not alongside any other response types). First, participants
were presented with a written label for 3s (e.g.~``cat'') and told to
focus their attention on the word. Once the written word disappeared, a
beep tone was played alongside the instruction ``close your eyes and
imagine this item'' (subjects were encouraged to close their eyes and
begin imagining the item as soon as they heard the tone, but the written
instruction were included as a further prompt). After 3s a second beep
tone sounded to alert subjects to open their eyes, where they were
presented with a photograph of the item they had been instructed to
imagine. On a 5-point scale, participants were asked to ``rate the
agreement between your mental image and the picture'', from ``low
agreement'' (1) to ``high agreement'' (5). The degree of agreement was
defined as ``how similar your mental image of the item is to the picture
shown''. A fixation cross was displayed for 1s before the next word item
was shown.

All responses were self-paced; the timing was only controlled during the
study/imagine section of the Mental Imagery Agreement block.

responses. ~ ~

\hypertarget{data-processing-1}{%
\paragraph{Data processing}\label{data-processing-1}}

The naming responses for each photograph item were manually assessed for
spelling and typing errors. Automatic spell checking software was
avoided in an effort to avoid inadvertently introducing unique names
that were not actually given by participants. The vast majority of
errors were unambiguous and easy to correct (e.g.~``anker'' =
``anchor'', ``peguin'' = ``penguin'', ``ssnowman'' = ``snowman''), or
consisted of transforming plural words to singular (or vice versa,
depending on the form of the intended label - e.g.~``sock'' to
``socks''). Some responses were a little more ambiguous, and
necessitated comparison to the photographs they were in response to for
additional clarity (e.g.~a photograph depicting a plug that would fit
into North American electrical sockets was labelled as ``usplug'' -
given the nature of our UK-based sample, it's likely the subject was
responding: ``U.S. (i.e.~United States) plug''.

There were instances where subjects provided a sensible and correctly
spelled English word, but that were clearly typos when examined against
the photograph they were in response to (e.g.~``dock'' for a photograph
depicting a duck, ``frock'' for a frog, and ``beer'' for a ``bear'',
etc). The most ambiguous spelling error to correct was ``bittle'', which
was provided by more than one participant and to more than one item;
separate inspections of the photographs participants were responding to
made this easy to correct though, with one participant clearly meaning
to respond ``bottle'', whilst the other meant to respond ``beetle''.
Though participants were instructed to only give a single label for each
item, some multiple word responses were found (without spaces) during
the spell checking process. On such occasions, a judgement was made
regarding whether multiple words were retained, or whether the response
could be shortened into a single word. A general rule was applied
whereby if the other words provided additional information, they were
retained (e.g.``maledear'' - presumably ``male deer'' - was kept as a
two-word answer). Multiple word responses were generally shortened into
a single word when the intended label for the item was clearly present,
and no information was lost in the process (e.g.~``haircomb'' was
shortened to the intended answer ``comb''). It is noted that there was
some inherent subjectivity in this process, though as such items were
not common among straightforward responses, their overall effects are
estimated to be negligible.

Finally, there were some responses that were changed to ``no'' as they
were clearly intended to signify that the responder did not know the
name of the item shown; the experiment instructed participants to type
``no'' in these instances, though the labels ``none'' and ``idk''
(common abbreviation for ``I don't know) were provided instead. There
was also a single response that was manually changed to''no``, as the
provided label was a single letter and thus entirely unclear what the
intended answer should be (see Appendix A for full list of manipulations
to naming responses). This process yielded data that could be used to
determine which photograph variation best matched the intended concepts
(e.g.~100\% of participants labelled the object ``bottle'', indicating a
perfect match), and which did not (e.g.~only 50\% of participants
labelled the item ``bottle'', whilst the other 50\% gave the label
``wine'', indicating a poor match). Photographs showing poor agreement
across participant-generated labels, or those where the majority of
labels differed from the intended concept, could be replaced with the
variation demonstrating the most accurate depiction.

\hypertarget{analysis-preperation}{%
\paragraph{Analysis preperation}\label{analysis-preperation}}

A number of variables were calculated prior to analysis. For
familiarity, visual complexity, colour diagnosticity, and mental imagery
agreement, mean ratings were calculated for each (see Appendix B). Mean
reaction times (RTs) were also calculated for each photograph / response
variable, including naming responses. For naming responses, accuracy was
defined as the proportion of subjects reporting the correct/intended
label for any given item (e.g.~80\% of subjects correctly labelled a
photograph of the moon as ``moon''). Percentage agreement was also
calculated (i.e.~the proportion of subjects providing the most frequent
name, regardless of whether it matched the correct/intended label) in
order to compute \emph{H} values for each item. The \emph{H} statistic
also reflects naming agreement, but it takes into account the total
number of unique labels given for an item. This is especially useful for
comparing similar items, as it captures information not provided by
simple agreement proportions. For instance, if the first variation of
the photo moon (`moon-1') demonstrated 90\% naming agreement among
subjects, and the second variation (`moon-2') also demonstrated 90\%
naming agreement, it would appear as if both versions offer the same
level of agreement among participants. However, `moon-1' may have
received a total of 2 unique names (e.g.~moon, planet), while `moon-2'
received a total of 4 unique names (e.g.~moon, planet, earth, comet).
\emph{H} values utilise this useful information to determine which item
shows the best naming agreement (in other words, the item with the least
number of unique names). The original formula by Snodgrass \& Vanderwart
(1980) was used to calculate \emph{H} values:

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./resources/images/h_calculation}

A \emph{H} value of 0 indicates perfect naming agreement (all subjects
responded with the same label for that item). Items showing a \emph{H}
value of 1 signify two unique names were provided, with identical
proportions (e.g.~10 subjects responded ``moon'' and 10 subjects
responded ``planet''). As the \emph{H} value increases, overall naming
agreement decreases.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\subsubsection{Results}\label{results-1}}

Summary statistics (mean and \emph{SD}) for each of the measured
variables are shown in Table 4. Data for the grey and colour photographs
are presented alongside previously obtained normative values for a
number of other stimuli formats (all obtained from Rossion \& Pourtois
(2004), who published revised norms for Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980)'s
(S\&V) original line drawings, as well as their own re-drawn versions
that contained shading and texture detail). The data from previous
studies were not used in any statistical analyses. To examine whether
the grey and colour photographs from the current study demonstrated any
differences, a series of independent samples t-tests were run on each
variable, as well as their corresponding reaction times (excluding
scores of colour diagnosticity, which were obtained only in response to
the colour items and thus cannot be compared). Mean (and \emph{SD})
values for all x816 unique photograph items are presented in Appendix B.

\hypertarget{naming}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Naming}}{Naming}}\label{naming}}

Naming accuracy was very high for all photographs (\emph{M} = 0.95),
indicating that overall, the selected items closely depicted the
intended concepts. Compared with the other stimuli formats, there
appears to be a steady increase in accuracy as items become more
distinctive (see Table 4). Accuracy rates did not differ between the
grey (\emph{M} = 0.94) and colour (\emph{M} = 0.95) versions of the
photographs {[}\(t(745.64) = -0.56\), \(p = .576\){]}.

\emph{H} values were also low across all items (\emph{M} = 0.23),
showing that subjects generally agreed on how the items should be named.
Similar to naming accuracy, naming agreement also appears to steadily
increase as items become more distinctive (as indicated by decreasing H
values - see Table 4. While Rossion \& Pourtois (2004) observed
significantly better naming agreement for their colour - rather than
greyscale - items, this pattern did not reach significance with the
current set of photographs; \emph{H} values did not differ between the
grey (\emph{M} = 0.24) and colour (\emph{M} = 0.22) photographs
{[}\(t(743.66) = 0.62\), \(p = .537\){]}.

A mean reaction time (RT) of (3.9s) was observed for naming responses.
While this was of little interest on its own, and could not be compared
to those obtained in response to the other stimuli formats as our
methodology was slightly different (RTs were only recorded when subjects
had typed their response \emph{and} clicked the mouse to signify they
had finished), they were useful for marking comparisons between the grey
and colour items (though no difference was observed {[}\emph{M} grey =
4s, \emph{M} colour = 3.8s, \(t(651.86) = 1.57\), \(p = .117\){]}).
Overall, these analyses suggest that the current photographs closely
resemble the drawings they were designed to match, with high levels of
naming accuracy and agreement among subjects. The absence of any colour
differences indicates there were no naming advantages when photographs
were made even more distinctive through the addition of colour.

values are presented in bold (SDs are shown in parentheses).

Scores of mental imagery agreement were moderate across all items
(\emph{M} = 3.6). While no colour differences were previously observed
between stimuli formats, the grey (\emph{M} = 3.46) photographs in the
current study showed significantly lower mental imagery agreement scores
than the colour (\emph{M} = 3.74) items {[}\(t(800.06) = -6.54\),
\(p < .001\){]}. Comparisons with previous normative data also highlight
how the grey photographs exhibited uniquely poorer mental imagery
agreement scores than any of the other stimuli formats (see Table 4).
RTs between the grey (\emph{M} = 3.04) and colour (\emph{M} = 2.81)
items did not significantly differ {[}\(t(571.37) = 2.14\),
\(p = .033\){]}.

\hypertarget{familiarity}{%

Familiarity scores were high overall (\emph{M} = 4.16), and like

familiarity as stimuli become more distinctive (from line drawings, to
grey shaded, to colour shaded), such a pattern was not evident with the
current photographs (see Table 4). RTs between the grey (\emph{M} =
0.97) and colour (\emph{M} = 0.98) items did not significantly differ
{[}\(t(783.66) = -0.30\), \(p = .762\){]}.

\hypertarget{visual-complexity}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Visual
complexity}}{Visual complexity}}\label{visual-complexity}}

Visual complexity ratings were moderate across all of the items
(\emph{M} = 3.3). Colour (\emph{M} = 3.16) photographs showed
significantly higher scores of visual complexity than grey (\emph{M} =
2.87) photographs {[}\(t(813.51) = -6.65\), \(p < .001\){]}. This
finding is further demonstrated when compared to the scores from the
other stimuli formats (see Table 4); where grey photographs show
comparable levels of visual complexity, the colour photographs show
higher scores than all of the other formats. There was no significant
difference between the RTs of grey (\emph{M} = 3.26) and colour
(\emph{M} = 3.35) items {[}\(t(754.08) = -1.21\), \(p = .228\){]}.

\hypertarget{selection-of-final-items}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Selection of final
items}}{Selection of final items}}\label{selection-of-final-items}}

For each concept represented in the photographs, one variation
(e.g.~shoe-1, shoe-2, or shoe-3) was selected for inclusion in a final
list of stimuli that would be taken forward into subsequent recognition
experiments. The normative naming data was assessed to establish which
version best matched the existing line-drawn depictions of the concepts
(Rossion \& Pourtois, 2004). Naming was favoured over all of the other
variables as, if an item was found to primarily convey a different
concept than was intended during the naming task (e.g.~if a photograph
of the fruit `orange' was labelled `grapefruit' by the majority of
subjects), then it could not be sufficiently compared to its line-drawn
(and written-word) counterpart during recognition studies.

At least 20 unique naming responses were collected for each of the 816
photographs (408 grey items and 408 colour items). The proportion of
`correct' responses (i.e.~names that were congruent with the intended
concept) and the proportion of `don't know' responses were calculated
for each item. Photographs were excluded if they:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  received a high proportion of ``don't know'' responses (20\%; all of
  the photographs depicted common, everyday objects, and so if a number
  of subjects were unable to name the item, that particular photograph
  was considered to be a poor representation of the item);
\item
  were incorrectly named by the majority of subjects (i.e.~if the
  proportion of correct responses equalled â¤ 50\%, since it was
  essential for the photographs to depict the same concepts as those
  found in the line drawings and word stimuli);
\item
  had particularly poor naming agreement (â¤ 20\% subjects named the
  object similarly). Items may not have been flagged by the second
  criteria (e.g.~if it received 4 different names, each with a 25\%
  ratio), but could still be considered poor representations of the
  intended concepts.
\end{enumerate}

54 photographs were found to meet at least one of the above criteria,
and therefore excluded. Regardless of whether these items were grey or
colour, it was also necessary to remove its grey or colour partner
(since both versions were needed to make comparisons across recognition
experiments). Thus, a total of 64 items (32 grey / 32 colour) were
excluded at this stage (many items already had both grey and colour
versions flagged by the original criteria).

Next, the proportion of correct responses were compared between grey and
colour photographs in order to identify items showing the lowest
difference. In order to manipulate colour in later recognition
experiments, it was important to select items where naming was congruent
across colour/grey items; in other words, it would be difficult to
attribute particular recognition response patterns to the addition of
colour (if a difference were found) when the grey version could not be
identified (or encoded) similarly. Variations exhibiting the least
difference between colour and grey items (for the proportion of correct
responses) were taken forward, while the rest were excluded. In a number
of instances, multiple variations for the same object had the same
`difference' score. For example, all three variations of the item
``balloon'' exhibited perfect naming agreement, irrespective of whether
they were presented in colour or grey (and thus ``balloon1'',
``balloon2'', and ``balloon3'' had a difference score of 0). For items
where more than 1 variation remained, manual rankings were obtained from
two of the researchers to determine which variation best depicted the
intended concept. For each item, the researchers independently studied
the remaining variations and provided a rank of which they thought was
best (1) to worst (2 or 3, depending on the number of variations that
remained). The ratings from both researchers were collated; items where
there was agreement as to which variation best depicted the intended
concept were selected for inclusion in the final stimuli list. For all
the items where there was disagreement between the researchers rankings,
one of the variations was simply selected at random.

\subsubsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}}

\hypertarget{the-role-of-colour}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{The role of
colour}}{The role of colour}}\label{the-role-of-colour}}

For naming responses (accuracy, agreement {[}\emph{H}{]}, and RTs), no
differences were observed between the grey and colour photographs. Such
a result was expected for accuracy and agreement scores; the
addition/absence of colour should not alter how participants identify
(and thus label) items, except in rare instances whereby a lack of
colour may lead to the misidentification of an object (e.g.~incorrectly
labelling a greyscale photograph of an orange as `grapefruit'). The data
indicates, however, that this was not common, with the grey set of
photographs exhibiting equally high levels of naming accuracy as the
colour photographs. The absence of RT differences between the colour and
greyscale sets was not expected for naming responses. It is reasonable
to assume that colour photographs - with an additional layer of
contextual information compared to grey items - would be identified (and
therefore named) quicker than grey photographs (e.g.~a colour photograph
of an orange should avoid the potential ambiguity that might accompany a
greyscale depiction, which could initially be confused for another type
of fruit). Indeed, Rossion \& Pourtois (2004) demonstrated RTs
consistent with this hypotheses, with colour drawings showing
significantly quicker RTs than grey items. The lack of difference in the
current data could be attributable to ceiling effects, whereby all
photographs were sufficiently unambiguous, and were quickly identified
irrespective of whether they were presented in greyscale or colour.
Examination of the other naming data, showing similarly high levels of
accuracy and agreement across grey and colour, supports this notion.

Scores of mental imagery agreement produced particularly interesting
results between the grey and colour items. Grey photographs exhibited a
significantly poorer match with subjects imagined presentation of the
objects than the colour items. Colour differences were not observed
previously between drawings (Rossion \& Pourtois, 2004), and comparing
the current data with that obtained in other studies (see Table 4)
demonstrates how the greyscale photographs show uniquely lower mental
imagery agreement scores compared with any of the other stimuli formats.
To imagine the objects, it seems likely that subjects would conjure an
image of how they naturally see the item in their everyday lives - which
for the majority of subjects, would presumably be a colour
representation. Therefore, when presented with greyscale depictions,
subjects may have been more inclined to report that that item did not
align quite as well as those presented in colour. However, it is unclear
why a similar pattern is not also evident when comparing grey and colour
drawings (Rossion \& Pourtois, 2004). It may be that photographs promote
stricter internal criteria when subjects must decide whether an item is
a good match to their mental image. With line-drawn / illustrated items,
subjects may simply accept that the items are baseline depictions, and
that they will only able to match their real-world mental images to a
certain degree - thus leading to a generally more liberal response bias
throughout. The addition of colour may therefore do very little to
further reconcile the match between the drawing and real-world mental
representation. When subjects are responding only to photographs, the
ecological nature of the items may facilitate deeper critical evaluation
of whether they offer a good match to mental images, and thus promote a
more conservative response bias. Colour may therefore be a far more
important factor in photographs than it is in line drawings for allowing
participants to decide whether an item matches well with their mental
image.

There were no colour differences in familiarity scores. This result was
expected - participants were asked to rate the degree to which they came
in contact with, or think about, the concept itself rather than the
particular depiction shown, and there is no apparent reason why colour
should influence such ratings. Visual complexity, on the other hand,
where participants were required to directly rate the amount of detail
in the picture, did show an expected difference. Colour photographs were
rated as significantly more visually complex than grey items, presumably
due to their additional layer of contextual information. When compared
to the previous data obtained for drawings, the greyscale photographs
showed comparable levels of visual complexity, while the colour
photographs showed higher levels than any of the other formats. It is
unclear why the photographs of the current study showed colour
differences, when grey and colour drawings did not differ, though it may
tie in with the hypotheses proposed to explain the mental imagery
agreement data. Subjects may apply stricter internal criteria when
rating stimuli that are perceived as being closer to how they would be
experienced in real life - when viewing a colour photograph of a rabbit,
it is difficult to see how we could make the item any more visually
complex than it already is (at least in a 2D medium). It's probable that
subjects notice the absence of colour when viewing the greyscale items,
since they depict the items in a way that they are not usually seen, and
thus determine that these items could be made more complex if they were
shown in colour (and so give lower visual complexity ratings as a
result).

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Establishing a new set of

The objective of the current study was to establish a new set of
ecological photograph stimuli to be taken forward into subsequent
recognition memory experiments. Matching items with previously
established drawings (and words) would allow for the effects of
stimuli-format on recognition response patterns to be directly examined.
A range of normative data was collected for 816 unique photograph items.
These items may prove useful for a range of cognitive researchers that
wish to utilise a set of high quality and realistic object stimuli,
especially given the flexibility of items that can be filtered based on
colour, naming agreement, familiarity, etc. For the needs of the current
body of research, the naming data was used to determine which
photographs best matched the intended concepts among a number of
possible variations. This allowed for the systematic comparison of
recognition memory performance toward three distinct stimuli formats
(words, drawings, and photographs) in the following study, in an effort
to establish how stimuli of varying perceptual distinctiveness may
affect recognition response patterns. Such comparisons might help to
reconcile the inconsistencies present across recognition memory
research, such as those attempted to determine whether familiarity
processes are preserved in those with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment
(aMCI).

\subsection{Experiment: Effect of stimuli format (greyscale) and
response option on recognition memory
judgements.}\label{experiment-effect-of-stimuli-format-greyscale-and-response-option-on-recognition-memory-judgements.}}

For the recognition memory experiment, everyday objects were presented
in three stimuli formats: i) words (written in simple, black ink); ii)
drawings (shaded line-drawn illustrations); and iii) photographs (detail
rich exemplars of the real world object). Rossion \& Pourtois (2004)
demonstrated that naming agreement could be improved by adding surface
texture and shading to the original Snodgrass \& Vanderwart (1980)
items; however, it is unclear how manipulations to distinctiveness
actually impact performance in recognition memory paradigms. As well as
general inconsistencies regarding the type of stimuli used in
recognition memory experiments, there is also much variability in the
response options available to participants when reporting their
recognition, for example: Remember/Know (Lombardi et al. (2016)),
Recollection/Familiarity (???), or Low/Med/High confidence (???). In the
current experiment, the availability of different response options when
reporting recognition will also be examined by randomly assigning
participants into a paradigm with three response options (Recollection /
Familiarity / Guessing) or four response options (RFG + Both).

Based on the results of Experiment 1, which compared recognition to for
words and drawings only, a number of hypotheses are proposed as to the
potential effects of adding a third stimuli format (highly distinctive
photograph stimuli). As stimuli become increasingly distinctive (from
words, to drawings, to photographs), it seems likely that the number of
hits (correctly recognised items) will increase, and the number of false
alarms (FAs) will decrease. RFG responses are expected to show a similar
pattern, with the most detailed stimuli showing the highest number of
hits assigned ``Recollection'', while the less detailed formats show
increasing levels of ``Familiarity'' and ``Guessing'' hits. Whilst we
expect the overall number of FAs to increase as stimuli become less
distinctive (i.e.~words will show the highest rate of FAs), there is no
reason to believe that these FAs will be biased toward any particular
RFG judgement across formats. It is also hypothesised that the rates of
reported Recollection and Familiarity will differ across response option
conditions (RFG / RFBG), though the direction of this difference is
currently unclear.

A total of 169 subjects completed the online experiment (see Table 5 for
a breakdown of the gender and age of the sample). To meet our YA
requirements, all participants were required to be between 18-59 years
of age (actual range: 18-58). As our experiment involved English word
stimuli, we also asked subjects whether English was their first
language; the vast majority (95.86\%) reported that English was indeed
their first language. Subjects were recruited from voluntary
participation websites such as
\href{https://www.prolific.co/}{Prolific Academic} (73.37\%), where
payment at the rate of Â£5/hr was given, and via the in-school
\href{https://keelepsychology.sona-systems.com/}{research participation system}
(15.38\%), where they received course participation credits. A small
number of participants were also recruited from
\href{https://psych.hanover.edu/research/exponnet.html}{Psychological Research on the Net}
(11.24\%). In order to detect a medium effect size of Cohen's \emph{f} =
0.25 with 80\% power (\emph{Î±} = .05, two-tailed), G\emph{Power
indicated that we would need 79 participants per group (}N* = 158) in a
3x2 mixed ANOVA.

A total of 126 innocuous, everyday objects (e.g.~clock, rabbit, shoe)
were presented across three individual stimuli formats: written words,
line drawings, and photographs. The line drawings were obtained from
Rossion \& Pourtois (2004), and consisted of greyscale shaded
illustrations that contained some surface details. The word stimuli were
simply the written word names of the line-drawn objects, presented in a
clear Sans-serif typeface. The photograph stimuli were curated in the
previous study; high quality photographs were sourced to similarly
depict the same everyday objects as the line drawings. All objects in
the photographs were isolated from their original background, converted
to greyscale, and rotated to match the orientations shown in the
line-drawn items.

\hypertarget{design-2}{%

The current study utilised a mixed design, with a 3-level
within-subjects factor of stimuli format (words, drawings, photographs),
and a 2-level between-subjects factor of response option (RFG, RFBG).
Subjects passed through 2 levels of blocked randomization (equally
sized, predetermined blocks); first, participants were randomly assigned
one of six possible study lists (of equal length, and containing an even
number of word, drawing, and photograph items) for counterbalancing
purposes. Subjects were then either assigned into a recognition test
with three possible response options (RFG: ``Recollection'',
``Familiarity'',``Guessing''), or four possible response options (RFBG:
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'', ``Guessing'', ``Both''). These
randomisation processes were completed automatically by the experiment
software using balanced methods.

\hypertarget{procedure-2}{%
\paragraph{Procedure}\label{procedure-2}}

Data was collected online using \href{https://gorilla.sc/}{Gorilla} - a
platform for the building and hosting of online experiments. The
experiment consisted of three self-paced phases: i) study phase, ii)
distractor task, and iii) recognition test. In the study phase, an even
mix of word, drawing, and photograph stimuli were presented
one-at-a-time on the computer screen. Subjects were instructed to learn
the items in preparation for a later memory test. To ensure attention
was directed to the presented stimuli, subjects were required to report
whether each item was shown as a word, drawing, or photograph using the
computer mouse. Following the study phase, participants completed some
simple multiple choice mathematical questions (e.g.~6 x 4 = ?) as a
distractor. Finally, participants memory of the previously studied items
was testing in the recognition task. An even mix of word, drawing, and
photograph stimuli were again presented one-at-a-time on the screen;
half of the test items had been shown previously in the study phase,
while the other half were new (and were not on the study list). For each
item, subjects were instructed to press \emph{Old} if they believed it
was an item they had studied earlier, and \emph{New} if they had not.
\emph{Old} responses led to a follow-up judgement, where participants
reported whether they had experienced recognition through
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'', or were simply taking an uninformed
``Guess''. Participants that had been randomised into the RFBG test
condition had a fourth option here, whereby they could report that they
had experienced Recollection and Familiarity simultaneously (``Both'').
Stimuli format was congruent across the study and test blocks
(e.g.~items presented as photos at study were also presented as photos
at test). For each concept depicted across the three stimuli formats,
subjects were only presented with one variation (in other words, if a
subject saw a photograph for the item ``shoe'', they did not see the
word or line-drawn version of ``shoe'').

\hypertarget{data-processing-2}{%
\paragraph{Data processing}\label{data-processing-2}}

Measured variables included the total number of hits and FAs, and the
total number of hits and FAs assigned to each of the available response
options (R/F/G and R/F/B/G). In order to create a common dependant
variable, proportions were calculated from these variables slightly
differently depending on the response option group. In the RFG-judgement
group, simple proportions were created from the total number of R
responses and the total number of F responses. In the RFBG condition,
however, the proportion of Both responses was separately added to R
proportions and F proportions. Additional DVs included: i) d' (d-prime,
a signal detection measure of sensitivity); ii) c-value (a measure of
response bias); iii) overall accuracy (hits / (hits + FAs)); iv)
reaction times for all responses.

Participants were excluded from analysis if they showed poor performance
during the encoding task; the relative ease of reporting whether each
item was shown as a word, drawing, or photograph prompted a performance
cut off of 90\% accuracy. This allowed for some accidental clicks /
incorrect responses toward potentially ambiguous items, though subjects
scoring less than 90\% were excluded on the assumption they did not
dedicate their full attention to the task. Subjects with extreme
z-scores were also excluded from analysis; those presenting z-scores of
+/- 3 (for total hits, total FAs, or overall recognition {[}hits minus
FAs{]}) were considered outliers. These criteria resulted in the
exclusion of 8 datasets, leaving a total of 161 in analyses.

\hypertarget{results-2}{%
\subsubsection{Results}\label{results-2}}

A series of 3x2 mixed ANOVAs were conducted on each of the DVs, using a
within-subjects factor of stimuli format (words / grey drawings / grey
photos) and a between-subjects factor of response option (RFG / RFBG);
the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied when data was found to
violate the assumption of sphericity (assessed using Mauchlys test
statistic). Significant main effects of stimuli format (and interaction
effects) were assessed using Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons.
When no interaction effects were present, significant main effects of
response option were assessed via standard two sample t-tests (when
group variances were equal) or Welch two sample t-test (when variances
were not equal); variance was assessed using Levene's test.

Likewise, grey drawings produced a significantly higher proportion of R

0.63{]} vs.~words {[}\emph{M}= {]}, \emph{t}(318) = -10.59, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) and RFBG conditions (grey drawings {[}\emph{M}=
0.46{]} vs.~words {[}\emph{M}= {]}, \emph{t}(318) = -5.93, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001).

The interaction is evident following comparisons of the same stimuli
format across response option conditions. The RFG group produced a
significantly higher proportion of R hits than the RFBG group for grey
photographs (RFG {[}\emph{M} = 0.78{]} vs.~RFBG {[}\emph{M} = 0.54{]},
\emph{t}(266.67) = -5.33, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and for grey
drawings (RFG {[}\emph{M} = 0.63{]} vs.~RFBG {[}\emph{M} = 0.46{]},
\emph{t}(266.67) = -3.72, \emph{p} = .004). However, this was not the
case for words, where there was no difference in the proportion of R
hits between the RFG (\emph{M} = ) and RFBG groups (\emph{M} = ;
\emph{t}(266.67) = -1.03, \emph{p} \textgreater{} .999).

Familiarity (hits)

Results from the ANOVA on the mean proportion of hits assigned
Familiarity showed a significant interaction between stimuli format and
response option condition, \emph{F}(1.61, 256.13) = 3.52, \emph{p} =
.041, \(\eta^2_p\) = .02 (see Figure 14).

In the RFG group, grey photographs (\emph{M}= ) produced a significantly
lower proportion of F hits than both words (\emph{M}= ; \emph{t}(318) =
10.72, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and grey drawings (\emph{M}= ;
\emph{t}(318) = 4.42, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). Grey drawings
(\emph{M}= ) in the RFG group similarly produced significantly fewer F
hits compared to words (\emph{M}= ; \emph{t}(318) = 6.30, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001). In the RFBG group, however, while grey photographs
(\emph{M}= ) again produced a significantly lower proportion of F hits
compared to words (\emph{M}= ; \emph{t}(318) = 6.77, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), the difference in comparison to grey drawings
(\emph{M}= ) was no longer evident, \emph{t}(318) = 1.82, \emph{p}
\textgreater{} .999). Grey drawings (\emph{M}= ) in the RFBG group did
continue to produce significantly fewer F hits compared to words
(\emph{M}= ; \emph{t}(318) = 4.96, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

Response option condition had no effect on the proportion of F hits
obtained, for either grey photographs (RFG {[}\emph{M} = {]} vs.~RFBG
{[}\emph{M} = {]}, \emph{t}(316.57) = 0.29, \emph{p} \textgreater{}
.999), grey drawings (RFG {[}\emph{M} = {]} vs.~RFBG {[}\emph{M} = {]},
\emph{t}(316.57) = -1.47, \emph{p} \textgreater{} .999), or words (RFG
{[}\emph{M} = {]} vs.~RFBG (\emph{M} = , \emph{t}(316.57) = -2.30,
\emph{p} = .336).

Guessing (hits)

The ANOVA on the mean proportion of hits assigned Guessing demonstrated
a significant main effect of stimuli format \emph{F}(1.33, 211.61) =
69.27, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .30. Grey photographs
(\emph{M}= 0.03) produced significantly fewer G hits in comparison to
both words (\emph{M}= 0.18; \emph{t}(160) = -9.35, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001; \emph{d} = -0.74, 95\% CI {[}-0.87, -0.63{]}) and grey drawings
(\emph{M}= 0.08; \emph{t}(160) = 5.85, \emph{p} \textless{} .001;
\emph{d} = 0.46, 95\% CI {[}0.34, 0.59{]}). The grey drawings (\emph{M}=
0.08) also showed a significantly lower proportion of G hits compared to
words (\emph{M}= 0.18; \emph{t}(160) = -7.54, \emph{p} \textless{} .001;
\emph{d} = -0.59, 95\% CI {[}-0.72, -0.5{]}. There were no significant
interaction effects between stimuli format and response option condition
\emph{F}(1.33, 211.61) = 1.28, \emph{p} = .269, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{}
.01.

To determine the effects of stimuli format and response option on the
classification of recognition memory judgements, separate 3 (stimuli
format: words, drawings, photographs) x 2 (response option condition:
RFG-judgements, RFBG-judgements) mixed ANOVAs were conducted on the mean
proportion of FAs assigned Recollection, Familiarity, and Guessing (see
Figure 15).

\includegraphics{R--Thesis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-40-1.pdf}
Figure 15: Proportion of FAs assigned Recollection, Familiarity, and
Guessing, by stimuli format and response option condition.

\textbf{Recollection (FAs)} For FAs assigned \emph{Recollection}, there
was no significant main effect of stimuli format {[}\emph{F}(1.92,
304.64) = 0.56, \emph{p} = .567, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01 or
interaction {[}\emph{F}(1.92, 304.64) = 1.04, \emph{p} = .352,
\(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01{]}.

Familiarity (FAs)

The ANOVA for FAs assigned \emph{Familiarity} showed a significant main
effect of stimuli format, \emph{F}(2, 318) = 8.66, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .05. Grey photographs (\emph{M}= 0.23) produced
significantly fewer F FAs than words (\emph{M}= 0.38), \emph{t}(160) =
-4.26, \emph{p} \textless{} .001; \emph{d} = -0.34, 95\% CI {[}-0.5,
-0.19{]}. Likewise, grey drawings (\emph{M}= 0.31) also showed a
significantly lower proportion of FAs compared to words (\emph{M}=
0.38), \emph{t}(160) = -1.97, \emph{p} = 0.15; \emph{d} = -0.16, 95\% CI
{[}-0.32, -0.0026{]}. However, there was no significant difference in
the proportion of FAs assigned Familiarity between grey photographs
(\emph{M}= 0.23) and grey drawings (\emph{M}= 0.31), \emph{t}(160) =
2.15, \emph{p} = 0.1; \emph{d} = 0.17, 95\% CI {[}0.02, 0.33{]}. There
were no significant interaction effects between stimuli format and
response option condition, \emph{F}(2, 318) = 2.53, \emph{p} = .081,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .02.

Guessing (FAs)

The ANOVA on the mean proportion of FAs assigned \emph{Guessing}
demonstrated a significant main effect of stimuli format \emph{F}(1.92,
305.67) = 8.95, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .05. Grey
photographs (\emph{M}= 0.13) produced significantly fewer G FAs in
comparison to words (\emph{M}= 0.27; \emph{t}(160) = -3.98, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001; \emph{d} = -0.31, 95\% CI {[}-0.48, -0.16{]}).
Likewise, grey drawings (\emph{M}= 0.17) also showed a significantly
lower proportion of FAs compared to words (\emph{M}= 0.27; \emph{t}(160)
= -2.7, \emph{p} = 0.02; \emph{d} = -0.21, 95\% CI {[}-0.37, -0.05{]}.
However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of FAs
assigned Guessing between grey photographs (\emph{M}= 0.13) and grey
drawings (\emph{M}= 0.17; \emph{t}(160) = 1.5, \emph{p} = 0.41; \emph{d}
= 0.12, 95\% CI {[}-0.04, 0.27{]}). There were also no significant
interaction effects between stimuli format and response option condition
\emph{F}(1.92, 305.67) = 0.31, \emph{p} = .725, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{}
.01.

In the previously discussed ANOVAs, significant main effects were also
observed for response option condition (RFG / RFBG) for the mean
proportion of hits (\emph{F}(1, 159) = 4.04, \emph{p} = .046,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .02) and the mean proportion of FAs assigned
\emph{Familiarity} (\emph{F}(1, 159) = 6.30, \emph{p} = .013,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .04). For all other variables, response option was found
to either significantly interact with stimuli format (discussed
previously), or had no significant main effect (see Table 7 for all
response option ANOVA results).

For the mean proportion of hits, follow up t-tests showed a higher
proportion of hits in the RFG group (\emph{M}= 0.74) compared to the
RFBG group (\emph{M}= 0.69), \emph{t}(481) = -2.37, \emph{p} = .018,
\emph{d} = 0.22. For the mean proportion of FAs assigned
\emph{Familiarity}, those in the RFG group (\emph{M}= 0.36) showed a
significantly higher proportion than those in the RFBG group (\emph{M}=
0.25), \emph{t}(480.99) = -3.12, \emph{p} = .002, \emph{d} = 0.28.

\subsubsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}}

Across a range of performance variables, the results show a clear effect
of stimuli distinctiveness. As distinctiveness increased (from words, to
drawings, to photographs), this produced more hits, less FAs, better
overall recognition, and better discrimination between hits / FAs. The
absence of any interaction effects across these variables demonstrates
that the availability of different response options (i.e.~the addition
of a Both option) had little impact on overall performance. RF(B)G
responses for accurate recognition displayed a similar pattern; as
distinctiveness increased, the number of Recollected hits also
increased, while the number of Familiarity and Guessing hits decreased.
The rate of both Familiarity FAs and Guessing FAs was also highest for
the least distinctive stimuli (words).

\section{Chapter 4 - The role of
colour}\label{chapter-4---the-role-of-colour}}

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

In \emph{Experiment 3}, this was demonstrated by comparing recognition
toward stimuli of increasing levels of distinctiveness: words,
line-drawn illustrated pictures, and detailed real-world photographs.

~

Another inconsistency across recognition studies relates to whether
picture stimuli are presented in greyscale or colour. The extent to
which colour alters the distinctiveness of stimuli is unclear, though
there is evidence to suggest it may play an important role in the
memorability of stimuli. In a two-alternative forced choice recognition
paradigm, Suzuki \& Takahashi (1997) demonstrated that black \& white
images may not facilitate successful recognition in the same way as
colour images. In an initial study phase, subjects were instructed to
passively memorise a number of picture stimuli, consisting of detailed
real-world photographs of scenes (e.g.~train stations, city streets
etc.). At test, participants were presented with two images side-by-side
(one target + one similar lure) and asked to select the item shown
during the study phase. Manipulations were also made with regard to the
congruency; photos were either presented in the same colour modality
across study and test (1. b\&w + b\&w; 2. colour + colour) or different
(3. b\&w + colour; 4. colour + b\&w). Participants were informed that
old photos may be presented in a different colour format (e.g.~a colour
item shown at study might not be shown in b\&w), and were also asked to
make a source judgement about whether the colour format for each item
was the same or different. Results showed that, of the four possible
congruency conditions, recognition performance was best when items were
congruently shown in colour at both study and test. Such findings
indicate colour information provided a recognition benefit at encoding
and retrieval, though interestingly, this benefit was \emph{only}
evident in the congruent colour condition; if colour images were shown
only at study, or only at test, there were no recognition benefits.
Performance on the source judgement question - regarding whether the the
colour of the item had changed since the study phase - was similar
across all four conditions, but performance was particularly poor for
items that had been presented in colour. This indicates recognition
benefits were not a result of accessing memory for the colour
information itself; Suzuki \& Takahashi (1997) instead hypothesised that
colour indirectly highlighted certain features within the photographs
that were not otherwise noticed as prominently in b\&w, and as a result,
the colour photographs were overall more distinctive.

(colour = no effect) StrÃ³Å¼ak

Indeed, colour images have previously been linked to enhanced memory
performance in recognition tasks (Ally et al., 2009a), though it was
difficult to disentangle the specific effects of colour from the
complexity of detail featured.

~

The current experiment aims to establish whether colour information
facilitates recognition

irrespective of the level of detail present in an image.

The methodology of \emph{Experiment 3} will be repeated utilising colour
(rather than greyscale) versions of both types of picture: i) a set of
simple, line-drawn object illustrations sourced from Rossion \& Pourtois
(2004); ii) a set of detailed real-world object photographs established
in \emph{Experiment 2}.

A secondary aim is to determine whether

these response patterns are differentially affected by the availability
of different response options at test
(\emph{Recollection}/\emph{Familiarity}/\emph{Guessing} or
\emph{Recollection}/\emph{Familiarity}/\emph{Both}/\emph{Guessing}).

It is hypothesised that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A photograph superiority effect (similar to that observed in
  \emph{Experiment 3}) will again be evident, whereby photograph items
  produce better recognition performance compared to drawings. Based on
  the results of the previous study, this performance benefit is
  expected to manifest as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      a higher proportion of correct hits;
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
    \setcounter{enumii}{1}
    \tightlist
    \item
      a lower proportion of false alarms (FAs);
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
    \setcounter{enumii}{2}
    \tightlist
    \item
      higher overall \emph{d'} scores.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Colour information will enhance the relative distinctiveness of
  picture stimuli, resulting in enhanced recognition performance
  compared to previously utilised greyscale items. Exploratory analyses
  comparing the results of the current study with those of
  \emph{Experiment 3} are expected to reveal numerical differences
  between the colour and greyscale findings, such that the colour items
  exhibit performance enhancements in the same direction as those
  outlined in Hypothesis 1 when compared to the greyscale items.
\item
  Any effects associated with manipulating the availability of response
  options at test (RFG/RFBG) will remain unaffected by the addition of
  colour information to picture stimuli. Based on the findings of
  \emph{Experiment 3}, it is expected that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The RFG group will produce a significantly higher proportion of
      overall hits compared to the RFBG group.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}
    \setcounter{enumii}{1}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The RFG group will produce a significantly higher proportion of
      FAs assigned \emph{Familiarity} compared to the RFBG group.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii})}

    \item
      Significant interaction effects between response option and

\hfill\break 164 participants completed the experiment online (see Table
8 for a breakdown of the age/gender of the current sample). All
participants were required to be between the age of 18-59 years in order
to meet our YA criteria (actual range: 18-57). As our experiment
involved written words as to-be-remembered stimuli, we also asked that
subjects first language be English; the vast majority (96.95\%) reported
that English was indeed their first language. Subjects were recruited
from the voluntary participation website
\href{https://www.prolific.co/}{Prolific Academic} (85.98\%), where
payment at the rate of Â£5/hr was given, and via the in-school
\href{https://keelepsychology.sona-systems.com/}{research participation system}
(14.02\%), where they received course participation credits.
\emph{G*Power} software was used to calculate an appropriate sample
size; to detect a medium effect size of Cohen's \emph{f} = 0.25 with
80\% power (\emph{Î±} = .05, two-tailed), 79 subjects per group would be
necessary (\emph{N} = 158) in a 3x2 mixed ANOVA.

\hfill\break Stimuli were the same as those utilised in \emph{Experiment
3}, except the greyscale drawings and photographs were substituted for
their colour versions. Items consisted of 126 innocuous, everyday
objects (e.g.~clock, rabbit, shoe), presented across three individual
stimuli formats: written words, line drawings, and photographs. Words
and line drawings were sourced from Rossion \& Pourtois (2004); the
drawings consisted of shaded, colour illustrations, and the words were
simply the written names of the depicted objects (these were presented
in a clear Sans-serif typeface in the current experiment). A matching
set of photograph stimuli were curated in \emph{Experiment 2}; high
quality photographs were sourced to similarly depict the same everyday
objects as those found in the Rossion \& Pourtois (2004) line drawings.
In each photograph, the object of interest was isolated from its
original background and rotated to match the orientations shown in the
line-drawn items. See Figure 16 for examples of each stimuli format.

\hypertarget{design-3}{%
\paragraph{Design}\label{design-3}}

\hfill\break A mixed 3x2 design was utilised, consisting of a
within-subjects factor of stimuli format (words, drawings, photographs)
and a between-subjects factor of response option (RFG, RFBG).
Counterbalancing was achieved via blocked randomisation, whereby
participants were presented with: 1) one of six possible study lists
(equal length, with the same number of words, drawings, and
photographs); 2) one of two possible recognition tests (either RFG:
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'', ``Guessing''), or RFBG:
``Recollection'', ``Familiarity'', ``Guessing'', ``Both''). All
counterbalancing routes were of equal length, and subjects were randomly
assigned into blocks via balanced methods.

\hypertarget{procedure-3}{%
\paragraph{Procedure}\label{procedure-3}}

\hfill\break The procedure was identical to that of \emph{Experiment 3};
data collection was conducted online using the experiment platform
\href{https://gorilla.sc/}{Gorilla}. All subjects completed three
self-paced phases: i) study phase, ii) distractor task, and iii)
recognition test. At study, subjects were instructed to learn each of
the word, drawing, and photograph items (shown at random, one-at-a-time)
in preparation for a later memory test. For each item, participants were
required to report whether the current format was a word, drawing, or
photograph - an encoding judgement that ensured attention was directed
toward the to-be-remembered stimuli. Next, subjects completed some
simple multiple choice mathematical questions (e.g.~6 x 4 = ?) as a
distractor task. Finally, participants were presented with the
recognition test; word, drawing, and photograph items were once again
shown one-at-a-time at random. Half of the test items had been shown
previously in the study phase, while the other half were new (not shown
at study). Subjects were first required to make an \emph{Old}/\emph{New}
judgement, based on whether they believed they had studied the item
earlier or not. While \emph{New} judgements simply led to the next item,
\emph{Old} judgements led to a follow-up screen where participants were
asked whether they had recognised the item via \emph{Recollection},
\emph{Familiarity}, or were simply \emph{Guessing} that it was old.
Those in the RFBG response option condition had an additional
\emph{Both} option at this stage, where they could report that they had
experienced recollection and familiarity simultaneously. Stimuli format
stayed the same across study and test (e.g.~if the item ``penguin'' was
shown in word format at study, it was also shown as a word at test), and
the same concepts were not repeated across the other formats
within-subjects (e.g.~if the item ``penguin'' was shown as a word, that
subject would not view the drawing or photo version).

\hfill\break The primary DVs of interest consisted of the mean
proportion of hits and false alarms (FAs), mean \emph{d'} scores
(d-prime, a signal detection measure of sensitivity), and the total
number of hits and FAs assigned to each of the available response
options (R/F/G or R/F/B/G). Proportions of Recollection and Familiarity
were calculated slightly differently depending on the response option
condition; in the RFG-judgement group, simple proportions were created
from the total number of R responses and the total number of F
responses. In the RFBG condition, the proportion of Both responses were
added separately to R proportions and F proportions. All analyses were
conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020) using the `rstatix' package
(v0.6.0; Kassambara, 2020).

Subjects were excluded from analyses on the basis of two key criteria;
1) less than 90\% accuracy during the encoding task (``Is this a word,
drawing, or photograph?''); 2) extreme z-scores (those presenting
z-scores of +/- 3 for total hits, total FAs, or overall recognition
{[}hits minus FAs{]}). A total of 3 participants were found to meet (at
least) one of these criteria, and were thus considered outliers and
excluded from analysis, leaving a total of 161 datasets.

\subsubsection{Results}\label{results-3}}

A series of 3x2 mixed ANOVAs were conducted on each of the DVs, with a
within-subjects factor of stimuli format (words / colour drawings /
colour photos) and a between-subjects factor of response option (RFG /
RFBG). Significant main effects and interaction effects were followed-up
with Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons. Greenhouse-Geisser
corrections were applied when ANOVA data was found to violate the
assumption of sphericity (assessed according to Mauchly's test
statistic).

Results from the ANOVAs demonstrated a significant main effect of
stimuli format for each of the key variables of interest; hits
(\emph{F}(1.70, 271.03) = 187.25, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .54), FAs (\emph{F}(1.26, 200.79) = 123.14, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .44), and \emph{d'} scores (\emph{F}(2,
318) = 465.93, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .75) - though
no interaction effects were evident between stimuli format and response
option; hits (\emph{F}(1.70, 271.03) = 1.22, \emph{p} = .291,
\(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01), FAs(\emph{F}(1.26, 200.79) = 2.72,
\emph{p} = .092, \(\eta^2_p\) = .02), or \emph{d'} scores (\emph{F}(2,
318) = 0.20, \emph{p} = .817, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01).

To determine whether photo superiority effects were exhibited in the
current set of colour stimuli - comparable to those previously observed
using greyscale items (Experiment 3) - pairwise t-tests were performed
between the colour photos and drawings. For the mean proportion of hits,
colour photographs (\emph{M}= 0.87) exhibited a significantly higher
proportion than colour drawings (\emph{M}= 0.73), \emph{t}(160) =
-11.04, \emph{p} \textless{} .001; \emph{d} = -0.87, 95\% CI {[}-1.04,
-0.74{]}. The photographs (\emph{M}= 0.04) also produced significantly
fewer FAs compared to drawings (\emph{M}= 0.08), \emph{t}(160) = 6.36,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001; \emph{d} = 0.5, 95\% CI {[}0.38, 0.64{]}).
Mean \emph{d'} scores were also significantly higher for the colour
photographs (\emph{M}= 3.25) compared to the colour drawings (\emph{M}=
2.39), \emph{t}(160) = -13.56, \emph{p} \textless{} .001; \emph{d} =
-1.07, 95\% CI {[}-1.27, -0.91{]}. These findings replicate those found
previously using greyscale items, whereby photographs offer a number of
recognition benefits when compared to less detailed line-drawn
illustrations.

Visual inspection of the data (and significant results) reveals only one
difference with regard to response option when compared to that obtained
in \emph{Experiment 3}: the ANOVA on \emph{d'} scores failed to produce
a significant interaction between stimuli format and response option in
the current experiment, as was previously demonstrated. Previous
follow-up comparisons revealed this interaction was driven by
numerically higher \emph{d'} scores for drawings in the RFBG group
compared to the RFG group - a deviation from words and photographs,
whereby \emph{d'} scores were both higher in the RFG group compared to
the RFBG group. The difference between \emph{d'} scores for drawings in
the RFG and RFBG groups did not reach significance though, and this
negligible difference may explain why such an interaction was absent in
the current study.

option on the classification of recognition memory judgements, separate
3 (stimuli format: words, drawings, photographs) x 2 (response option

\textbf{Recollection (hits):} Results from the ANOVA on the mean
proportion of hits assigned Recollection showed a significant
interaction between stimuli format and response option condition,
\emph{F}(1.39, 221.56) = 10.79, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\)
= .06 (see Figure 19).

Comparisons across stimuli formats showed colour photographs produced a
significantly higher proportion of R hits than both words and colour
drawings in both the RFG group (colour photographs {[}\emph{M}= 0.76{]}
vs.~words {[}\emph{M}= 0.32{]}, \emph{t}(318) = -15.02, \emph{p}

Likewise, colour drawings produced a significantly higher proportion of
R hits in comparison to Words in both the RFG (colour drawings
{[}\emph{M}= 0.63{]} vs.~words {[}\emph{M}= 0.32{]}, \emph{t}(318) =
-10.49, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and RFBG conditions (colour drawings
{[}\emph{M}= 0.46{]} vs.~words {[}\emph{M}= 0.3{]}, \emph{t}(318) =
-5.06, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

The interaction is evident following comparisons of the same stimuli
format across response option conditions. The RFG group produced a
significantly higher proportion of R hits than the RFBG group for colour
photographs (RFG {[}\emph{M} = 0.76{]} vs.~RFBG {[}\emph{M} = 0.56{]},
\emph{t}(274.37) = -4.19, \emph{p} = .001) and for colour drawings (RFG
{[}\emph{M} = 0.63{]} vs.~RFBG {[}\emph{M} = 0.46{]}, \emph{t}(274.37) =
-3.43, \emph{p} = .011). However, this was not the case for words, where
there was no difference in the proportion of R hits between the RFG
(\emph{M} = 0.32) and RFBG groups (\emph{M} = 0.3; \emph{t}(274.37) =
-0.30, \emph{p} \textgreater{} .999).

\textbf{Familiarity (hits):} Results from the ANOVA on the mean
proportion of hits assigned Familiarity again showed a significant main
effect of stimuli format \emph{F}(1.49, 236.15) = 50.18, \emph{p}

format \emph{F}(1.29, 204.70) = 82.24, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .34. Colour photographs (\emph{M}= 0.02) produced

\emph{p} = 0.05; \emph{d} = -0.19, 95\% CI {[}-0.35, -0.04{]}. However,
there was no significant difference in the proportion of FAs assigned
Familiarity between colour photographs (\emph{M}= 0.16) and colour
drawings (\emph{M}= 0.31), \emph{t}(160) = 4.65, \emph{p} \textless{}

\textbf{Guessing (FAs):} The ANOVA on the mean proportion of FAs
assigned \emph{Guessing} demonstrated a significant main effect of
stimuli format \emph{F}(2, 318) = 16.11, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .09. Colour photographs (\emph{M}= 0.15) produced

CI {[}-0.51, -0.21{]}). Likewise, colour drawings (\emph{M}= 0.15) also

between colour photographs (\emph{M}= 0.15) and colour drawings
(\emph{M}= 0.15), \emph{t}(160) = -0.15, \emph{p} = 1; \emph{d} = -0.01,
95\% CI {[}-0.17, 0.15{]}). There were also no significant interaction
effects between stimuli format and response option condition \emph{F}(2,
318) = 1.57, \emph{p} = .210, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01.

Visual inspection of the data in Figure 17 and Figure 18 demonstrates a
highly similar pattern of responding between \emph{Experiment 3} and the
current study, and suggest the addition of colour had little impact on
RFG response patterns.

\hypertarget{response-option-availability-1}{%
\paragraph{Response option
availability}\label{response-option-availability-1}}

\hfill\break In each of the aforementioned ANOVAs, the role of response
option was also examined to determine whether the addition of colour
information had any differential effects compared to the findings of
\emph{Experiment 3}. The only main effect of response option was
observed in the ANOVA for the mean proportion of FAs (\emph{F}(1, 159) =
1.03, \emph{p} = .312, \(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01), whereby a higher
proportion of FAs was evident in the RFG group (\emph{M}= 0.13) compared
to the RFBG group (\emph{M}= 0.1), \emph{t}(457.34) = -2.43, \emph{p} =
.016, \emph{d} = 0.22. Such results do not support Hypothesis 3, where
significant main effects of response option were expected in the ANOVAs
for the mean proportion of hits and mean proportion of FAs assigned
\emph{Familiarity}. Similarly, the expected interactions for mean
\emph{d'} scores and proportion of hits assigned \emph{Familiarity} were
also absent. The only consistent finding across \emph{Experiment 3} and
the current experiment (with regard to response option) comes from the
ANOVA for the mean proportion of hits assigned \emph{Recollection} -
where a significant interaction between stimuli format and response
option was apparent in both experiments; in both experiments, the
proportion of R hits did not differ across RFG and RFBG groups for word
stimuli, whereas for drawings and photographs, the RFG group produced a
significantly higher proportion of R hits than the RFBG group.

\subsubsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-3}}

In \emph{Experiment 3}, recognition performance was found to improve in
a linear fashion as the intended distinctiveness increased, from words
to line drawings to photographs. While standard PSEs were expected, the
most notable finding was the superiority of photographs compared to line
drawings, a result that offered support for the physical distinctiveness
hypothesis over dual-coding theory.

the current set of photograph stimuli as being more distinctive than
words when presented in greyscale, in seemed unnecessary to make this
comparison again. Instead, the following analyses specifically aimed to
determine whether colour photographs were more distinctive than colour
drawings, or if distinctiveness `peaked' such that colour drawings and
photographs resulted in comparable recognition performance/

Taken together, the findings indicate that the colour photographs were
indeed more distinctive than the colour drawings, and that the current
set of stimuli appear to effectively capture different `levels' of
stimuli distinctiveness.

Visual comparison of the data from \emph{Experiment 3} (greyscale
drawings and photographs) and that obtained in the current study
indicates that colour has a negligible impact on stimuli distinctiveness
(see Figure 20). While there were clear performance differences between
the different levels of stimuli distinctiveness in both studies,

Performance, in terms of the proportion of hits, FAs, and overall
recognition accuracy, appears the same irrespective of whether greyscale
or colour pictures were used.

In turn, this further implicates the stimuli format as the

Comparisons are made in relation to the first two experiments of Ensor
et al. (2019), the methodologies of which were identical to one another,
apart from the number of trials involved (one experiment consisting of
40 trials at study and 80 at test, and the other consisting of 80 trials
at study and 160 at test). With regard to trial numbers, the current
study sits between the two Ensor et al. (2019) experiments, with 60
trials at study and 120 at test.

\paragraph{Manipulation check}\label{manipulation-check}}

To establish whether the distinctive word stimuli were indeed more
distinctive than regular words, a series of one-way repeated measures
analyses of variance (ANOVA) - using six factors (grey \& distinctive
words, grey \& colour drawings, grey \& colour photographs) - were
conducted on the mean scores of \emph{d'}, mean proportions of hits, and
mean proportion of FAs. Sphericity was assessed using Mauchly's Test;
when the assumption of sphericity was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser
corrections were applied.

Throughout each of the conducted ANOVAs, there was consistently a
significant main effect of stimuli format: mean proportion of hits
{[}\emph{F}(3.95, 619.49) = 137.94, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .47{]}, mean proportion of FAs {[}\emph{F}(2.83, 443.69)
= 52.71, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .25{]},
\emph{d'}-scores {[}\emph{F}(4.74, 744.81) = 190.22, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .55{]}. Planned comparisons following
these significant results, however, did not always demonstrate that the
distinctive word stimuli were indeed any more distinctive than the
regular word stimuli. Primarily, there was no difference in the
proportion of overall hits between distinctive (\emph{M} = 0.61) and
regular words (\emph{M} = 0.58), \emph{t}(157) = 1.26, \emph{p} = .211,
\emph{d} = 0.10 - recognition performance (i.e.~the number of items
subjects were able to correctly identify) was the same regardless of the
format word stimuli were presented in. Subjects did, however, make
significantly fewer FAs as a result of the manipulation (distinctive
words \emph{M} = 0.05, regular words \emph{M} = 0.18; \emph{t}(157) =
-8.70, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \emph{d} = -0.69), offering some
support to the manipulation, as subjects were better able to correctly
reject lure items when they were presented in a distinctive format,
rather than regular format, highlighting some performance benefits.
Furthermore, distinctive words (\emph{M} = 2.23) also showed
significantly higher \emph{d'} scores than regular words (\emph{M} =
1.49), \emph{t}(157) = 7.96, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \emph{d} = 0.63;
subjects were better able to accurately discriminate between hits and
FAs when responding to the distinctive words over regular words.

Raw data provided by Ensor et al. (2019) was re-analysed to allow for
direct comparisons with data from the current study. For evidence of the
manipulation check:

For mean \emph{d'} scores, there were significant main effects of
stimuli format in both the first {[}\emph{F}(3, 87) = 10.99, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .27{]} and second {[}\emph{F}(3, 87) =
19.01, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .40{]} experiments.
Follow-up comparisons showed evidence of the distinctiveness
manipulation, whereby distinctive words produced significantly higher
\emph{d'} scores compared to regular words in both experiments (see
Table 11). Visual inspection of the data shows that the \emph{d'} scores
obtained in the current experiment sit between the Ensor et al. (2019)
experiments - in line with reducing scores as the number of trials
increases.

The ANOVA on the mean proportion of hits also showed evidence of the
distinctiveness manipulation; significant main effects of stimuli format
in their first {[}\emph{F}(3, 87) = 10.91, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .27{]} and second {[}\emph{F}(3, 87) = 8.37, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .22{]} experiments produced follow-up
comparisons that consistently showed distinctive words resulted in
significantly more hits than regular words (see Table 12). This is in
contrast to the results of the current study, whereby no difference was
found as a result of the distinctiveness manipulation. Visual inspection
of the data does not indicate the number of trials had an impact on the
number of hits; while Ensor et al. (2019) did observe a reduction in the
proportion of hits for both word formats when trial numbers were
increased, the current study still showed a lower proportion of hits
than both of the Ensor et al. (2019) experiments (including the
experiment with more trials).

For the mean proportion of FAs, the second experiment of Ensor et al.
(2019) showed a significant main effect of stimuli format {[}\emph{F}(3,
87) = 6.05, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .17{]}, much like
the currents study. However, while the current study showed distinctive
words produced significantly fewer FAs than regular words, this
comparison was not significant for Ensor et al. (2019) (see Table 13).
In their first experiment, there was no significant main effect of
stimuli format {[}\emph{F}(3, 87) = 1.41, \emph{p} = .245, \(\eta^2_p\)
= .05{]}, or follow-up comparison. Visual inspection of the data shows
that subjects generally made more FAs in the Ensor et al. (2019)
experiments compared to the current study; this is especially apparent
when comparisons are made toward the experiment with more trials.

A key finding in Ensor et al. (2019) data was an elimination of the PSE;
distinctive word stimuli and grey drawings produced similar \emph{d'}
scores, indicative of comparable distinctiveness between the two stimuli
formats. Such findings were replicated in the current reanalysis of
their data (see Table 14). In the current experiment, however, this
finding was not replicated, with drawings showing significantly higher
\emph{d'} than the distinctive words, suggesting the manipulation was
not effective.

Similarly, Ensor et al. (2019) also showed no difference in the number
of hits between the distinctive words and grey drawings, across both
experiments (see Table 15). This again suggests their distinctiveness
manipulation was successful in eliminating the PSE, however, such a
finding was not apparent in the current study, where grey drawings
produced significantly more hits than the distinctive words.

Finally, Ensor et al. (2019) also showed no difference in the number of
FAs between the distinctive words and grey drawings, across both
experiments (see Table 16) - an expected result if the distinctiveness
manipulation resulted in similar levels between the distinctive words
and grey drawings. Again, the current experiment produced different
results; interestingly though, there were significantly more FAs for the
grey drawings, as opposed to the distinctive word stimuli. This is
somewhat unexpected, since the rest of the findings identify the grey
drawings as having increased memorability compared to the distinctive
words.

\subsubsection{Recollection and
Familiarity}\label{recollection-and-familiarity-2}}

To determine if recollection and familiarity response patterns were
mediated by the format of word stimuli, further one-way repeated
measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on the mean
proportion of hits and false alarms (FAs) assigned \emph{Recollection}
(R), \emph{Familiarity} (F), and \emph{Guessing} (G).

\includegraphics{R--Thesis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-84-1.pdf}
Figure 23: Mean d' scores by stimuli format and recognition judgement.

\newpage

For responses assigned \emph{Recollection}, there was a significant main
effect of stimuli format for the mean proportion of hits
{[}\emph{F}(3.10, 486.70) = 73.92, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .32{]}, mean proportion of FAs {[}\emph{F}(4.38, 687.03)
= 3.89, \emph{p} = .003, \(\eta^2_p\) = .02{]}, and mean \emph{d'}
scores {[}\emph{F}(4.40, 690.83) = 40.88, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .21{]}.

\textbf{Distinctiveness manipulation (regular words vs.~distinctive
words):} Across each of the variables, the distinctive word stimuli
indeed appeared to be more distinctive than the regular words. Planned
comparisons showed that distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.48) produced
significantly more R hits than regular words (\emph{M} = 0.36),
\emph{t}(157) = 4.74, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \emph{d} = 0.38, and
also significantly higher \emph{d'} scores (distinctive words \emph{M} =
1.99, regular words \emph{M} = 1.26, \emph{t}(157) = 5.25, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \emph{d} = 0.42. Conversely, regular words (\emph{M} =
0.1) produced a significantly higher proportion of FAs assigned R than
distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.04), \emph{t}(157) = -2.65, \emph{p} =
.009, \emph{d} = -0.21.

\textbf{Elimination of the PSE (distinctive words vs.~greyscale
drawings):} Grey drawings (\emph{M} = 0.56) produced a significantly
higher number of hits assigned R compared to the distinctive words
(\emph{M} = 0.48), \emph{t}(157) = -3.64, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\emph{d} = -0.29.

On the other hand, the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.04) produced
significantly fewer FAs assigned R than grey drawings (\emph{M} = 0.11),
\emph{t}(157) = -2.41, \emph{p} = .017, \emph{d} = -0.19. This somewhat
extended to the colour drawings, where there was no difference between
the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.04) and colour drawings (\emph{M} =
0.06), \emph{t}(157) = 0.71, \emph{p} = .478, \emph{d} = 0.06.
Comparisons with grey photos, however, showed a return of the PSE, as
the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.04) produced a significantly higher
number of R FAs than grey photo (\emph{M} = 0.07), \emph{t}(157) =
-2.41, \emph{p} = .017, \emph{d} = -0.19.

For \emph{d'} scores, there was an elimination of the PSE; distinctive
words (\emph{M} = 1.99) and grey drawings (\emph{M} = 2.01) showed no
significant difference in mean \emph{d'} scores, \emph{t}(157) = -0.09,
\emph{p} = .932, \emph{d} \textless{} 0.01.

\textbf{Extension to colour drawings}: Elimination of the PSE for
\emph{d'} scores did not extend to colour drawings. Colour drawings
(\emph{M} = 2.34) showed significantly higher \emph{d'} scores than the
distinctive words (\emph{M} = 1.99), \emph{t}(157) = 2.30, \emph{p} =
.023, \emph{d} = 0.18.

\textbf{Extension to photos:} Grey photos (\emph{M} = 2.81) showed
significantly higher \emph{d'} scores than the distinctive words
(\emph{M} = 1.99), \emph{t}(157) = -4.95, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\emph{d} = -0.39.

Colour photos (\emph{M} = 3.1) showed significantly higher \emph{d'}
scores than the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 1.99), \emph{t}(157) =
8.26, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \emph{d} = 0.66.

\newpage

For responses assigned \emph{Familiarity}, there was again a significant
main effect of stimuli format across all of the variables; the mean
proportion of hits {[}\emph{F}(3.09, 484.95) = 25.45, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .14{]}, mean proportion of FAs
{[}\emph{F}(4.54, 713.44) = 15.62, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .09{]}, and mean \emph{d'} scores {[}\emph{F}(4.52,
709.38) = 2.52, \emph{p} = .033, \(\eta^2_p\) = .02{]}.

\textbf{Distinctiveness manipulation (regular words vs.~distinctive
words):}

Regular words (\emph{M} = 0.48) produced significantly more F hits than
the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.41), \emph{t}(157) = -2.53, \emph{p}
= .012, \emph{d} = -0.20, and significantly more F FAs (regular words
\emph{M} = 0.38, distinctive words \emph{M} = 0.19, \emph{t}(157) =
-4.56, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \emph{d} = -0.36. \emph{d'} scores,
however, were significantly higher for the distinctive words (\emph{M} =
1.15) compared to the regular words (\emph{M} = 0.5), \emph{t}(157) =
2.93, \emph{p} = .004, \emph{d} = 0.23.

\textbf{Elimination of the PSE (distinctive words vs.~greyscale
drawings):}

For the proportion of F hits, the PSE was eliminated, with no
significant difference between distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.41) and
grey drawings (\emph{M} = 0.38), \emph{t}(157) = 0.84, \emph{p} = .403,
\emph{d} = 0.07. Likewise, there was no significant difference for the
number of FAs assigned F between distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.19) and
grey drawings (\emph{M} = 0.23), \emph{t}(157) = -1.24, \emph{p} = .219,
\emph{d} = -0.10. For \emph{d'} scores, there was again an elimination
of the PSE; distinctive words (\emph{M} = 1.15) and grey drawings
(\emph{M} = 0.83) showed no significant difference in mean \emph{d'}
scores, \emph{t}(157) = 1.54, \emph{p} = .125, \emph{d} = 0.12.

\textbf{Extension to colour drawings}: Elimination of the PSE for
\emph{d'} scores also extended to colour drawings. Mean \emph{d'} scores
were not significantly different between distinctive words (\emph{M} =
1.15) and colour drawings (\emph{M} = 0.86), \emph{t}(157) = -1.33,
\emph{p} = .184, \emph{d} = -0.11.

\textbf{Extension to photos:} Elimination of the PSE for \emph{d'}
scores also extended to grey photos. Mean \emph{d'} scores were not
significantly different between distinctive words (\emph{M} = 1.15) and
grey photos (\emph{M} = 0.81), \emph{t}(157) = 1.58, \emph{p} = .116,
\emph{d} = 0.13.

Elimination of the PSE for \emph{d'} scores also extended to colour
photos. Mean \emph{d'} scores were not significantly different between
distinctive words (\emph{M} = 1.15) and colour photos (\emph{M} = 1.04),
\emph{t}(157) = -0.63, \emph{p} = .527, \emph{d} = -0.05.

\newpage

For responses assigned \emph{Guessing}, there was a significant main
effect of stimuli format for the mean proportion of hits
{[}\emph{F}(2.99, 468.71) = 24.58, \emph{p} \textless{} .001,
\(\eta^2_p\) = .14{]} and mean proportion of FAs {[}\emph{F}(4.69,
736.23) = 4.66, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, \(\eta^2_p\) = .03{]}.
However, the main effect of mean \emph{d'} scores did not reach
significance {[}\emph{F}(4.51, 708.09) = 1.57, \emph{p} = .172,
\(\eta^2_p\) \textless{} .01{]}; visual inspection of this data shows
that across the stimuli formats, \emph{d'} scores were generally
negative for \emph{Guessing} responses, an expected pattern that shows
poor discrimination and often more FAs than hits.

\textbf{Distinctiveness manipulation (regular words vs.~distinctive
words):} There was no difference in the number of hits assigned G
between regular words (\emph{M} = 0.13) and distinctive words (\emph{M}
= 0.1), \emph{t}(157) = -1.75, \emph{p} = .082, \emph{d} = -0.14, no
difference in the number of FAs assigned G between regular words
(\emph{M} = 0.19) and distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.15), \emph{t}(157)
= -1.10, \emph{p} = .275, \emph{d} = -0.09, and no difference in mean
\emph{d'} scores between regular words (\emph{M} = -0.12) and
distinctive words (\emph{M} = -0.08), \emph{t}(157) = 0.23, \emph{p} =
.815, \emph{d} = 0.02.

\textbf{Elimination of the PSE (distinctive words vs.~greyscale
drawings):}

For the proportion of G hits, the distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.1)
produced a significantly higher proportion compared to the grey drawings
(\emph{M} = 0.05), \emph{t}(157) = 3.28, \emph{p} = .001, \emph{d} =
0.26. There was no significant difference for the number of FAs assigned
G between distinctive words (\emph{M} = 0.15) and grey drawings
(\emph{M} = 0.1), \emph{t}(157) = 1.41, \emph{p} = .161, \emph{d} =
0.11, or mean \emph{d'} scores (distinctive words \emph{M} = -0.08, grey
drawings \emph{M} = -0.1, \emph{t}(157) = 0.10, \emph{p} = .920,
\emph{d} \textless{} 0.01.
